Rethinking inland NE- I mean, there's a bit of divide from the seaboard and those away from the coast. Maine, for instance, has a huge divide between the coast(Main Lobster, for instance), and Northern Maine(Moose-hunters and low population density). This extends across the region, and the Maritime provinces further North make the distinction more pronounced. Particularly, such a region would extend from Watertown to Nova Scotia/Newfoundland. There'd be a sharp distinction between the coastal regions, with larger cities, higher household income, and farming communities, and the inland portions, such as Vermont, New Hampshire, Northern Maine, and the Hudson Valley. Not exactly the same, but I don't think the full region is compatible from tip to tip.

Awesome 
 
True, we can consoladate(sic) w/ out reducing us into super-regions, which would also be a good idea. However, many provinces and states borders don't adequately reflect cultural borders or interests; this was the reason for splitting Maine from Mass., for instance. These consolodations(sic) should be considered, to one extent or another, to bettwe reflect interests and commonalities. For instance, NYS is dominated by NYC; the state, despite being one of the original colonies, has several different regions, all of them underrepresented both at the state and federal level. For its part, the NYC region is basically New Jersey; for New Jersey's part, it's basically eastern PA. The Hudson is basically New England, and us wNYers are Rust Belters and Great Lakers. 
 
Like I said, luckily I suck at MS Paint and used a thick brush. Exact borders are always difficult, but atleast putting a few down helps reflect divergent interests that need to be properly balanced. Otherwise, you end up with a bunch of people forced to call themselves western New Yorkers(shudders) constantly bitching about how their taxes get sent to a city 14 hrs away.

I am in no way a Hitlerite but the NSDAP's agenda regarding the unification with Austria is nothing other than the ideal of a united German people - the overcoming of centuries of monarchist, liberal, secessionist, and religious fratricide. The name wasn't changed because calling the German peoples' State 'Germany' makes sense. The DNSAP were racial patriots, while the Fatherland Front were civic patriots which, considering the events ongoing at the time, more or less amounted to being racial separatists. 
As to DC being a monument to ""USA"" history, as Figlio pointed out, we fail to see where our paths separate post-1816. The only blip I can think of where our two countries didn't stand together, die together, and bleed together is the Vietnam Conflict. And even then, thousands of Canadians still served in the US armed forces to fight Viet Cong. Of the thousands of names in the Vietnam Memorial, many are yours. DC is a living city, constantly evolving with the changing winds of history. I'm certain that measures would be taken to make it a city Canadians consider their own as well.

QFT. I had this idea as well, but I wasn't anywhere as radical as your proposal.

Lesser populated agricultural States need to be merged, with a little fiddling perhaps in the Midwest. I think the Canadian provinces should remain separate too, for their own identity's sake. Minnesotans might talk like Manitobans, and Mainers might talk like Nova Scotians, but I wouldn't want to lose either region's cultural identities. I agree with Love's initial opinion on this. Super-regions are unnecessary as well as burdensome to govern and control. 
 
I see you have the Bahamas and Bermuda under North American control. I'd really only do this if NATO/Europe starts to give us shit. Then I'd take the Mid-Atlantic islands down to the Malvinas and the Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific as well. That'll ring the entire hemisphere in NAU-controlled islands.

A STUDY OF THE POPULAR MIND 
BY GUSTAVE LE BON {b. May 7, 1841--d. Dec 13, 1931} 
The following work is devoted to an account of the 
characteristics of crowds. 
The whole of the common characteristics with which heredity 
endows the individuals of a race constitute the genius of the 
race. When, however, a certain number of these individuals are 
gathered together in a crowd for purposes of action, observation 
proves that, from the mere fact of their being assembled, there 
result certain new psychological characteristics, which are added 
to the racial characteristics and differ from them at times to a 
very considerable degree. 
Organised crowds have always played an important part in the life 
of peoples, but this part has never been of such moment as at 
present. The substitution of the unconscious action of crowds 
for the conscious activity of individuals is one of the principal 
characteristics of the present age. 
I have endeavoured to examine the difficult problem presented by 
crowds in a purely scientific manner--that is, by making an 
effort to proceed with method, and without being influenced by 
opinions, theories, and doctrines. This, I believe, is the only 
mode of arriving at the discovery of some few particles of truth, 
especially when dealing, as is the case here, with a question 
that is the subject of impassioned controversy. A man of science 
bent on verifying a phenomenon is not called upon to concern 
himself with the interests his verifications may hurt. In a 
recent publication an eminent thinker, M. Goblet d'Alviela, made 
the remark that, belonging to none of the contemporary schools, I 
am occasionally found in opposition of sundry of the conclusions 
of all of them. I hope this new work will merit a similar 
observation. To belong to a school is necessarily to espouse its 
prejudices and preconceived opinions. 
Still I should explain to the reader why he will find me draw 
conclusions from my investigations which it might be thought at 
first sight they do not bear; why, for instance, after noting the 
extreme mental inferiority of crowds, picked assemblies included, 
I yet affirm it would be dangerous to meddle with their 
organisation, notwithstanding this inferiority. 
The reason is, that the most attentive observation of the facts 
of history has invariably demonstrated to me that social 
organisms being every whit as complicated as those of all beings, 
it is in no wise in our power to force them to undergo on a 
sudden far-reaching transformations. Nature has recourse at 
times to radical measures, but never after our fashion, which 
explains how it is that nothing is more fatal to a people than 
the mania for great reforms, however excellent these reforms may 
appear theoretically. They would only be useful were it possible 
to change instantaneously the genius of nations. This power, 
however, is only possessed by time. Men are ruled by ideas, 
sentiments, and customs--matters which are of the essence of 
ourselves. Institutions and laws are the outward manifestation 
of our character, the expression of its needs. Being its 
outcome, institutions and laws cannot change this character. 
The study of social phenomena cannot be separated from that of 
the peoples among whom they have come into existence. From the 
philosophic point of view these phenomena may have an absolute 
value; in practice they have only a relative value. 
It is necessary, in consequence, when studying a social 
phenomenon, to consider it successively under two very different 
aspects. It will then be seen that the teachings of pure reason 
are very often contrary to those of practical reason. There are 
scarcely any data, even physical, to which this distinction is 
not applicable. From the point of view of absolute truth a cube 
or a circle are invariable geometrical figures, rigorously 
defined by certain formulas. From the point of view of the 
impression they make on our eye these geometrical figures may 
assume very varied shapes. By perspective the cube may be 
transformed into a pyramid or a square, the circle into an 
ellipse or a straight line. Moreover, the consideration of these 
fictitious shapes is far more important than that of the real 
shapes, for it is they and they alone that we see and that can be 
reproduced by photography or in pictures. In certain cases there 
is more truth in the unreal than in the real. To present objects 
with their exact geometrical forms would be to distort nature and 
render it unrecognisable. If we imagine a world whose 
inhabitants could only copy or photograph objects, but were 
unable to touch them, it would be very difficult for such persons 
to attain to an exact idea of their form. Moreover, the 
knowledge of this form, accessible only to a small number of 
learned men, would present but a very minor interest. 
The philosopher who studies social phenomena should bear in mind 
that side by side with their theoretical value they possess a 
practical value, and that this latter, so far as the evolution of 
civilisation is concerned, is alone of importance. The 
recognition of this fact should render him very circumspect with 
regard to the conclusions that logic would seem at first to 
enforce upon him. 
There are other motives that dictate to him a like reserve. The 
complexity of social facts is such, that it is impossible to 
grasp them as a whole and to foresee the effects of their 
reciprocal influence. It seems, too, that behind the visible 
facts are hidden at times thousands of invisible causes. Visible 
social phenomena appear to be the result of an immense, 
unconscious working, that as a rule is beyond the reach of our 
analysis. Perceptible phenomena may be compared to the waves, 
which are the expression on the surface of the ocean of 
deep-lying disturbances of which we know nothing. So far as the 
majority of their acts are considered, crowds display a 
singularly inferior mentality; yet there are other acts in which 
they appear to be guided by those mysterious forces which the 
ancients denominated destiny, nature, or providence, which we 
call the voices of the dead, and whose power it is impossible to 
overlook, although we ignore their essence. It would seem, at 
times, as if there were latent forces in the inner being of 
nations which serve to guide them. What, for instance, can be 
more complicated, more logical, more marvellous than a language? 
Yet whence can this admirably organised production have arisen, 
except it be the outcome of the unconscious genius of crowds? 
The most learned academics, the most esteemed grammarians can do 
no more than note down the laws that govern languages; they would 
be utterly incapable of creating them. Even with respect to the 
ideas of great men are we certain that they are exclusively the 
offspring of their brains? No doubt such ideas are always 
created by solitary minds, but is it not the genius of crowds 
that has furnished the thousands of grains of dust forming the 
soil in which they have sprung up? 
Crowds, doubtless, are always unconscious, but this very 
unconsciousness is perhaps one of the secrets of their strength. 
In the natural world beings exclusively governed by instinct 
accomplish acts whose marvellous complexity astounds us. Reason 
is an attribute of humanity of too recent date and still too 
imperfect to reveal to us the laws of the unconscious, and still 
more to take its place. The part played by the unconscious in 
all our acts is immense, and that played by reason very small. 
The unconscious acts like a force still unknown. 
If we wish, then, to remain within the narrow but safe limits 
within which science can attain to knowledge, and not to wander 
in the domain of vague conjecture and vain hypothesis, all we 
must do is simply to take note of such phenomena as are 
accessible to us, and confine ourselves to their consideration. 
Every conclusion drawn from our observation is, as a rule, 
premature, for behind the phenomena which we see clearly are 
other phenomena that we see indistinctly, and perhaps behind 
these latter, yet others which we do not see at all.

INTRODUCTION. THE ERA OF CROWDS. 
The evolution of the present age--The great changes in 
civilisation are the consequence of changes in National 
thought--Modern belief in the power of crowds--It transforms the 
traditional policy of the European states--How the rise of the 
popular classes comes about, and the manner in which they 
exercise their power--The necessary consequences of the power of 
the crowd--Crowds unable to play a part other than 
destructive--The dissolution of worn-out civilisations is the 
work of the crowd--General ignorance of the psychology of crowds-- 
Importance of the study of crowds for legislators and statesmen. 
The great upheavals which precede changes of civilisations such 
as the fall of the Roman Empire and the foundation of the Arabian 
Empire, seem at first sight determined more especially by 
political transformations, foreign invasion, or the overthrow of 
dynasties. But a more attentive study of these events shows that 
behind their apparent causes the real cause is generally seen to 
be a profound modification in the ideas of the peoples. The true 
historical upheavals are not those which astonish us by their 
grandeur and violence. The only important changes whence the 
renewal of civilisations results, affect ideas, conceptions, and 
beliefs. The memorable events of history are the visible effects 
of the invisible changes of human thought. The reason these 
great events are so rare is that there is nothing so stable in a 
race as the inherited groundwork of its thoughts. 
The present epoch is one of these critical moments in which the 
thought of mankind is undergoing a process of transformation. 
Two fundamental factors are at the base of this transformation. 
The first is the destruction of those religious, political, and 
social beliefs in which all the elements of our civilisation are 
rooted. The second is the creation of entirely new conditions of 
existence and thought as the result of modern scientific and 
industrial discoveries. 
The ideas of the past, although half destroyed, being still very 
powerful, and the ideas which are to replace them being still in 
process of formation, the modern age represents a period of 
transition and anarchy. 
It is not easy to say as yet what will one day be evolved from 
this necessarily somewhat chaotic period. What will be the 
fundamental ideas on which the societies that are to succeed our 
own will be built up? We do not at present know. Still it is 
already clear that on whatever lines the societies of the future 
are organised, they will have to count with a new power, with the 
last surviving sovereign force of modern times, the power of 
crowds. On the ruins of so many ideas formerly considered beyond 
discussion, and to-day decayed or decaying, of so many sources of 
authority that successive revolutions have destroyed, this power, 
which alone has arisen in their stead, seems soon destined to 
absorb the others. While all our ancient beliefs are tottering 
and disappearing, while the old pillars of society are giving way 
one by one, the power of the crowd is the only force that nothing 
menaces, and of which the prestige is continually on the 
increase. The age we are about to enter will in truth be the ERA 
OF CROWDS. 
Scarcely a century ago the traditional policy of European states 
and the rivalries of sovereigns were the principal factors that 
shaped events. The opinion of the masses scarcely counted, and 
most frequently indeed did not count at all. To-day it is the 
traditions which used to obtain in politics, and the individual 
tendencies and rivalries of rulers which do not count; while, on 
the contrary, the voice of the masses has become preponderant. 
It is this voice that dictates their conduct to kings, whose 
endeavour is to take note of its utterances. The destinies of 
nations are elaborated at present in the heart of the masses, and 
no longer in the councils of princes. 
The entry of the popular classes into political life--that is to 
say, in reality, their progressive transformation into governing 
classes--is one of the most striking characteristics of our epoch 
of transition. The introduction of universal suffrage, which 
exercised for a long time but little influence, is not, as might 
be thought, the distinguishing feature of this transference of 
political power. The progressive growth of the power of the 
masses took place at first by the propagation of certain ideas, 
which have slowly implanted themselves in men's minds, and 
afterwards by the gradual association of individuals bent on 
bringing about the realisation of theoretical conceptions. It is 
by association that crowds have come to procure ideas with 
respect to their interests which are very clearly defined if not 
particularly just, and have arrived at a consciousness of their 
strength. The masses are founding syndicates before which the 
authorities capitulate one after the other; they are also 
founding labour unions, which in spite of all economic laws tend 
to regulate the conditions of labour and wages. They return to 
assemblies in which the Government is vested, representatives 
utterly lacking initiative and independence, and reduced most 
often to nothing else than the spokesmen of the committees that 
have chosen them. 
To-day the claims of the masses are becoming more and more 
sharply defined, and amount to nothing less than a determination 
to utterly destroy society as it now exists, with a view to 
making it hark back to that primitive communism which was the 
normal condition of all human groups before the dawn of 
civilisation. Limitations of the hours of labour, the 
nationalisation of mines, railways, factories, and the soil, the 
equal distribution of all products, the elimination of all the 
upper classes for the benefit of the popular classes, &amp;c., such 
are these claims. 
Little adapted to reasoning, crowds, on the contrary, are quick 
to act. As the result of their present organisation their 
strength has become immense. The dogmas whose birth we are 
witnessing will soon have the force of the old dogmas; that is to 
say, the tyrannical and sovereign force of being above 
discussion. The divine right of the masses is about to replace 
the divine right of kings. 
The writers who enjoy the favour of our middle classes, those who 
best represent their rather narrow ideas, their somewhat 
prescribed views, their rather superficial scepticism, and their 
at times somewhat excessive egoism, display profound alarm at 
this new power which they see growing; and to combat the disorder 
in men's minds they are addressing despairing appeals to those 
moral forces of the Church for which they formerly professed so 
much disdain. They talk to us of the bankruptcy of science, go 
back in penitence to Rome, and remind us of the teachings of 
revealed truth. These new converts forget that it is too late. 
Had they been really touched by grace, a like operation could not 
have the same influence on minds less concerned with the 
preoccupations which beset these recent adherents to religion. 
The masses repudiate to-day the gods which their admonishers 
repudiated yesterday and helped to destroy. There is no power, 
Divine or human, that can oblige a stream to flow back to its 
source. 
There has been no bankruptcy of science, and science has had no 
share in the present intellectual anarchy, nor in the making of 
the new power which is springing up in the midst of this anarchy. 
Science promised us truth, or at least a knowledge of such 
relations as our intelligence can seize: it never promised us 
peace or happiness. Sovereignly indifferent to our feelings, it 
is deaf to our lamentations. It is for us to endeavour to live 
with science, since nothing can bring back the illusions it has 
destroyed. 
Universal symptoms, visible in all nations, show us the rapid 
growth of the power of crowds, and do not admit of our supposing 
that it is destined to cease growing at an early date. Whatever 
fate it may reserve for us, we shall have to submit to it. All 
reasoning against it is a mere vain war of words. Certainly it 
is possible that the advent to power of the masses marks one of 
the last stages of Western civilisation, a complete return to 
those periods of confused anarchy which seem always destined to 
precede the birth of every new society. But may this result be 
prevented? 
Up to now these thoroughgoing destructions of a worn-out 
civilisation have constituted the most obvious task of the 
masses. It is not indeed to-day merely that this can be traced. 
History tells us, that from the moment when the moral forces on 
which a civilisation rested have lost their strength, its final 
dissolution is brought about by those unconscious and brutal 
crowds known, justifiably enough, as barbarians. Civilisations 
as yet have only been created and directed by a small 
intellectual aristocracy, never by crowds. Crowds are only 
powerful for destruction. Their rule is always tantamount to a 
barbarian phase. A civilisation involves fixed rules, 
discipline, a passing from the instinctive to the rational state, 
forethought for the future, an elevated degree of culture--all of 
them conditions that crowds, left to themselves, have invariably 
shown themselves incapable of realising. In consequence of the 
purely destructive nature of their power crowds act like those 
microbes which hasten the dissolution of enfeebled or dead 
bodies. When the structure of a civilisation is rotten, it is 
always the masses that bring about its downfall. It is at such a 
juncture that their chief mission is plainly visible, and that 
for a while the philosophy of number seems the only philosophy of 
history. 
Is the same fate in store for our civilisation? There is ground 
to fear that this is the case, but we are not as yet in a 
position to be certain of it. 
However this may be, we are bound to resign ourselves to the 
reign of the masses, since want of foresight has in succession 
overthrown all the barriers that might have kept the crowd in 
check. 
We have a very slight knowledge of these crowds which are 
beginning to be the object of so much discussion. Professional 
students of psychology, having lived far from them, have always 
ignored them, and when, as of late, they have turned their 
attention in this direction it has only been to consider the 
crimes crowds are capable of committing. Without a doubt 
criminal crowds exist, but virtuous and heroic crowds, and crowds 
of many other kinds, are also to be met with. The crimes of 
crowds only constitute a particular phase of their psychology. 
The mental constitution of crowds is not to be learnt merely by a 
study of their crimes, any more than that of an individual by a 
mere description of his vices. 
However, in point of fact, all the world's masters, all the 
founders of religions or empires, the apostles of all beliefs, 
eminent statesmen, and, in a more modest sphere, the mere chiefs 
of small groups of men have always been unconscious 
psychologists, possessed of an instinctive and often very sure 
knowledge of the character of crowds, and it is their accurate 
knowledge of this character that has enabled them to so easily 
establish their mastery. Napoleon had a marvellous insight into 
the psychology of the masses of the country over which he 
reigned, but he, at times, completely misunderstood the 
psychology of crowds belonging to other races;[1] and it is 
because he thus misunderstood it that he engaged in Spain, and 
notably in Russia, in conflicts in which his power received blows 
which were destined within a brief space of time to ruin it. A 
knowledge of the psychology of crowds is to-day the last resource 
of the statesman who wishes not to govern them--that is becoming 
a very difficult matter--but at any rate not to be too much 
governed by them. 
[1] His most subtle advisers, moreover, did not understand this 
psychology any better. Talleyrand wrote him that ""Spain would 
receive his soldiers as liberators.""  It received them as beasts 
of prey. A psychologist acquainted with the hereditary instincts 
of the Spanish race would have easily foreseen this reception. 
It is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology 
of crowds that it can be understood how slight is the action upon 
them of laws and institutions, how powerless they are to hold any 
opinions other than those which are imposed upon them, and that 
it is not with rules based on theories of pure equity that they 
are to be led, but by seeking what produces an impression on them 
and what seduces them. For instance, should a legislator, 
wishing to impose a new tax, choose that which would be 
theoretically the most just? By no means. In practice the most 
unjust may be the best for the masses. Should it at the same 
time be the least obvious, and apparently the least burdensome, 
it will be the most easily tolerated. It is for this reason that 
an indirect tax, however exorbitant it be, will always be 
accepted by the crowd, because, being paid daily in fractions of 
a farthing on objects of consumption, it will not interfere with 
the habits of the crowd, and will pass unperceived. Replace it 
by a proportional tax on wages or income of any other kind, to be 
paid in a lump sum, and were this new imposition theoretically 
ten times less burdensome than the other, it would give rise to 
unanimous protest. This arises from the fact that a sum 
relatively high, which will appear immense, and will in 
consequence strike the imagination, has been substituted for the 
unperceived fractions of a farthing. The new tax would only 
appear light had it been saved farthing by farthing, but this 
economic proceeding involves an amount of foresight of which the 
masses are incapable. 
The example which precedes is of the simplest. Its appositeness 
will be easily perceived. It did not escape the attention of 
such a psychologist as Napoleon, but our modern legislators, 
ignorant as they are of the characteristics of a crowd, are 
unable to appreciate it. Experience has not taught them as yet 
to a sufficient degree that men never shape their conduct upon 
the teaching of pure reason. 
Many other practical applications might be made of the psychology 
of crowds. A knowledge of this science throws the most vivid 
light on a great number of historical and economic phenomena 
totally incomprehensible without it. I shall have occasion to 
show that the reason why the most remarkable of modern 
historians, Taine, has at times so imperfectly understood the 
events of the great French Revolution is, that it never occurred 
to him to study the genius of crowds. He took as his guide in 
the study of this complicated period the descriptive method 
resorted to by naturalists; but the moral forces are almost 
absent in the case of the phenomena which naturalists have to 
study. Yet it is precisely these forces that constitute the true 
mainsprings of history. 
In consequence, merely looked at from its practical side, the 
study of the psychology of crowds deserved to be attempted. Were 
its interest that resulting from pure curiosity only, it would 
still merit attention. It is as interesting to decipher the 
motives of the actions of men as to determine the characteristics 
of a mineral or a plant. Our study of the genius of crowds can 
merely be a brief synthesis, a simple summary of our 
investigations. Nothing more must be demanded of it than a few 
suggestive views. Others will work the ground more thoroughly. 
To-day we only touch the surface of a still almost virgin soil. 
BOOK I 
THE MIND OF CROWDS 
CHAPTER I 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CROWDS.--PSYCHOLOGICAL LAW OF THEIR 
MENTAL UNITY. 
What constitutes a crowd from the psychological point of view--A 
numerically strong agglomeration of individuals does not suffice 
to form a crowd--Special characteristics of psychological 
crowds--The turning in a fixed direction of the ideas and 
sentiments of individuals composing such a crowd, and the 
disappearance of their personality--The crowd is always dominated 
by considerations of which it is unconscious--The disappearance 
of brain activity and the predominance of medullar activity--The 
lowering of the intelligence and the complete transformation of 
the sentiments--The transformed sentiments may be better or worse 
than those of the individuals of which the crowd is composed--A 
crowd is as easily heroic as criminal. 
In its ordinary sense the word ""crowd"" means a gathering of 
individuals of whatever nationality, profession, or sex, and 
whatever be the chances that have brought them together. From 
the psychological point of view the expression ""crowd"" assumes 
quite a different signification. Under certain given 
circumstances, and only under those circumstances, an 
agglomeration of men presents new characteristics very different 
from those of the individuals composing it. The sentiments and 
ideas of all the persons in the gathering take one and the same 
direction, and their conscious personality vanishes. A 
collective mind is formed, doubtless transitory, but presenting 
very clearly defined characteristics. The gathering has thus 
become what, in the absence of a better expression, I will call 
an organised crowd, or, if the term is considered preferable, a 
psychological crowd. It forms a single being, and is subjected 
to the LAW OF THE MENTAL UNITY OF CROWDS. 
It is evident that it is not by the mere fact of a number of 
individuals finding themselves accidentally side by side that 
they acquire the character of an organised crowd. A thousand 
individuals accidentally gathered in a public place without any 
determined object in no way constitute a crowd from the 
psychological point of view. To acquire the special 
characteristics of such a crowd, the influence is necessary of 
certain predisposing causes of which we shall have to determine 
the nature. 
The disappearance of conscious personality and the turning of 
feelings and thoughts in a definite direction, which are the 
primary characteristics of a crowd about to become organised, do 
not always involve the simultaneous presence of a number of 
individuals on one spot. Thousands of isolated individuals may 
acquire at certain moments, and under the influence of certain 
violent emotions--such, for example, as a great national 
event--the characteristics of a psychological crowd. It will be 
sufficient in that case that a mere chance should bring them 
together for their acts to at once assume the characteristics 
peculiar to the acts of a crowd. At certain moments half a dozen 
men might constitute a psychological crowd, which may not happen 
in the case of hundreds of men gathered together by accident. On 
the other hand, an entire nation, though there may be no visible 
agglomeration, may become a crowd under the action of certain 
influences. 
A psychological crowd once constituted, it acquires certain 
provisional but determinable general characteristics. To these 
general characteristics there are adjoined particular 
characteristics which vary according to the elements of which the 
crowd is composed, and may modify its mental constitution. 
Psychological crowds, then, are susceptible of classification; 
and when we come to occupy ourselves with this matter, we shall 
see that a heterogeneous crowd--that is, a crowd composed of 
dissimilar elements--presents certain characteristics in common 
with homogeneous crowds--that is, with crowds composed of 
elements more or less akin (sects, castes, and classes)--and side 
by side with these common characteristics particularities which 
permit of the two kinds of crowds being differentiated. 
But before occupying ourselves with the different categories of 
crowds, we must first of all examine the characteristics common 
to them all. We shall set to work like the naturalist, who 
begins by describing the general characteristics common to all 
the members of a family before concerning himself with the 
particular characteristics which allow the differentiation of the 
genera and species that the family includes. 
It is not easy to describe the mind of crowds with exactness, 
because its organisation varies not only according to race and 
composition, but also according to the nature and intensity of 
the exciting causes to which crowds are subjected. The same 
difficulty, however, presents itself in the psychological study 
of an individual. It is only in novels that individuals are 
found to traverse their whole life with an unvarying character. 
It is only the uniformity of the environment that creates the 
apparent uniformity of characters. I have shown elsewhere that 
all mental constitutions contain possibilities of character which 
may be manifested in consequence of a sudden change of 
environment. This explains how it was that among the most savage 
members of the French Convention were to be found inoffensive 
citizens who, under ordinary circumstances, would have been 
peaceable notaries or virtuous magistrates. The storm past, they 
resumed their normal character of quiet, law-abiding citizens. 
Napoleon found amongst them his most docile servants. 
It being impossible to study here all the successive degrees of 
organisation of crowds, we shall concern ourselves more 
especially with such crowds as have attained to the phase of 
complete organisation. In this way we shall see what crowds may 
become, but not what they invariably are. It is only in this 
advanced phase of organisation that certain new and special 
characteristics are superposed on the unvarying and dominant 
character of the race; then takes place that turning already 
alluded to of all the feelings and thoughts of the collectivity 
in an identical direction. It is only under such circumstances, 
too, that what I have called above the PSYCHOLOGICAL LAW OF THE 
MENTAL UNITY OF CROWDS comes into play. 
Among the psychological characteristics of crowds there are some 
that they may present in common with isolated individuals, and 
others, on the contrary, which are absolutely peculiar to them 
and are only to be met with in collectivities. It is these 
special characteristics that we shall study, first of all, in 
order to show their importance. 
The most striking peculiarity presented by a psychological crowd 
is the following: Whoever be the individuals that compose it, 
however like or unlike be their mode of life, their occupations, 
their character, or their intelligence, the fact that they have 
been transformed into a crowd puts them in possession of a sort 
of collective mind which makes them feel, think, and act in a 
manner quite different from that in which each individual of them 
would feel, think, and act were he in a state of isolation. 
There are certain ideas and feelings which do not come into 
being, or do not transform themselves into acts except in the 
case of individuals forming a crowd. The psychological crowd is 
a provisional being formed of heterogeneous elements, which for a 
moment are combined, exactly as the cells which constitute a 
living body form by their reunion a new being which displays 
characteristics very different from those possessed by each of 
the cells singly. 
Contrary to an opinion which one is astonished to find coming 
from the pen of so acute a philosopher as Herbert Spencer, in the 
aggregate which constitutes a crowd there is in no sort a 
summing-up of or an average struck between its elements. What 
really takes place is a combination followed by the creation of 
new characteristics, just as in chemistry certain elements, when 
brought into contact--bases and acids, for example--combine to 
form a new body possessing properties quite different from those 
of the bodies that have served to form it. 
It is easy to prove how much the individual forming part of a 
crowd differs from the isolated individual, but it is less easy 
to discover the causes of this difference. 
To obtain at any rate a glimpse of them it is necessary in the 
first place to call to mind the truth established by modern 
psychology, that unconscious phenomena play an altogether 
preponderating part not only in organic life, but also in the 
operations of the intelligence. The conscious life of the mind 
is of small importance in comparison with its unconscious life. 
The most subtle analyst, the most acute observer, is scarcely 
successful in discovering more than a very small number of the 
unconscious motives that determine his conduct. Our conscious 
acts are the outcome of an unconscious substratum created in the 
mind in the main by hereditary influences. This substratum 
consists of the innumerable common characteristics handed down 
from generation to generation, which constitute the genius of a 
race. Behind the avowed causes of our acts there undoubtedly lie 
secret causes that we do not avow, but behind these secret causes 
there are many others more secret still which we ourselves 
ignore. The greater part of our daily actions are the result of 
hidden motives which escape our observation. 
It is more especially with respect to those unconscious elements 
which constitute the genius of a race that all the individuals 
belonging to it resemble each other, while it is principally in 
respect to the conscious elements of their character--the fruit 
of education, and yet more of exceptional hereditary 
conditions--that they differ from each other. Men the most 
unlike in the matter of their intelligence possess instincts, 
passions, and feelings that are very similar. In the case of 
every thing that belongs to the realm of sentiment--religion, 
politics, morality, the affections and antipathies, &amp;c.--the most 
eminent men seldom surpass the standard of the most ordinary 
individuals. From the intellectual point of view an abyss may 
exist between a great mathematician and his boot maker, but from 
the point of view of character the difference is most often 
slight or non-existent. 
It is precisely these general qualities of character, governed by 
forces of which we are unconscious, and possessed by the majority 
of the normal individuals of a race in much the same degree--it 
is precisely these qualities, I say, that in crowds become common 
property. In the collective mind the intellectual aptitudes of 
the individuals, and in consequence their individuality, are 
weakened. The heterogeneous is swamped by the homogeneous, and 
the unconscious qualities obtain the upper hand. 
This very fact that crowds possess in common ordinary qualities 
explains why they can never accomplish acts demanding a high 
degree of intelligence. The decisions affecting matters of 
general interest come to by an assembly of men of distinction, 
but specialists in different walks of life, are not sensibly 
superior to the decisions that would be adopted by a gathering of 
imbeciles. The truth is, they can only bring to bear in common 
on the work in hand those mediocre qualities which are the 
birthright of every average individual. In crowds it is 
stupidity and not mother-wit that is accumulated. It is not all 
the world, as is so often repeated, that has more wit than 
Voltaire, but assuredly Voltaire that has more wit than all the 
world, if by ""all the world"" crowds are to be understood. 
If the individuals of a crowd confined themselves to putting in 
common the ordinary qualities of which each of them has his 
share, there would merely result the striking of an average, and 
not, as we have said is actually the case, the creation of new 
characteristics. How is it that these new characteristics are 
created? This is what we are now to investigate. 
Different causes determine the appearance of these 
characteristics peculiar to crowds, and not possessed by isolated 
individuals. The first is that the individual forming part of a 
crowd acquires, solely from numerical considerations, a sentiment 
of invincible power which allows him to yield to instincts which, 
had he been alone, he would perforce have kept under restraint. 
He will be the less disposed to check himself from the 
consideration that, a crowd being anonymous, and in consequence 
irresponsible, the sentiment of responsibility which always 
controls individuals disappears entirely. 
The second cause, which is contagion, also intervenes to 
determine the manifestation in crowds of their special 
characteristics, and at the same time the trend they are to take. 
Contagion is a phenomenon of which it is easy to establish the 
presence, but that it is not easy to explain. It must be classed 
among those phenomena of a hypnotic order, which we shall shortly 
study. In a crowd every sentiment and act is contagious, and 
contagious to such a degree that an individual readily sacrifices 
his personal interest to the collective interest. This is an 
aptitude very contrary to his nature, and of which a man is 
scarcely capable, except when he makes part of a crowd. 
A third cause, and by far the most important, determines in the 
individuals of a crowd special characteristics which are quite 
contrary at times to those presented by the isolated individual. 
I allude to that suggestibility of which, moreover, the contagion 
mentioned above is neither more nor less than an effect. 
To understand this phenomenon it is necessary to bear in mind 
certain recent physiological discoveries. We know to-day that by 
various processes an individual may be brought into such a 
condition that, having entirely lost his conscious personality, 
he obeys all the suggestions of the operator who has deprived him 
of it, and commits acts in utter contradiction with his character 
and habits. The most careful observations seem to prove that an 
individual immerged for some length of time in a crowd in action 
soon finds himself--either in consequence of the magnetic 
influence given out by the crowd, or from some other cause of 
which we are ignorant--in a special state, which much resembles 
the state of fascination in which the hypnotised individual finds 
himself in the hands of the hypnotiser. The activity of the 
brain being paralysed in the case of the hypnotised subject, the 
latter becomes the slave of all the unconscious activities of his 
spinal cord, which the hypnotiser directs at will. The conscious 
personality has entirely vanished; will and discernment are lost. 
All feelings and thoughts are bent in the direction determined by 
the hypnotiser. 
Such also is approximately the state of the individual forming 
part of a psychological crowd. He is no longer conscious of his 
acts. In his case, as in the case of the hypnotised subject, at 
the same time that certain faculties are destroyed, others may be 
brought to a high degree of exaltation. Under the influence of a 
suggestion, he will undertake the accomplishment of certain acts 
with irresistible impetuosity. This impetuosity is the more 
irresistible in the case of crowds than in that of the hypnotised 
subject, from the fact that, the suggestion being the same for 
all the individuals of the crowd, it gains in strength by 
reciprocity. The individualities in the crowd who might possess 
a personality sufficiently strong to resist the suggestion are 
too few in number to struggle against the current. At the 
utmost, they may be able to attempt a diversion by means of 
different suggestions. It is in this way, for instance, that a 
happy expression, an image opportunely evoked, have occasionally 
deterred crowds from the most bloodthirsty acts. 
We see, then, that the disappearance of the conscious 
personality, the predominance of the unconscious personality, the 
turning by means of suggestion and contagion of feelings and 
ideas in an identical direction, the tendency to immediately 
transform the suggested ideas into acts; these, we see, are the 
principal characteristics of the individual forming part of a 
crowd. He is no longer himself, but has become an automaton who 
has ceased to be guided by his will. 
Moreover, by the mere fact that he forms part of an organised 
crowd, a man descends several rungs in the ladder of 
civilisation. Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a 
crowd, he is a barbarian--that is, a creature acting by instinct. 
He possesses the spontaneity, the violence, the ferocity, and 
also the enthusiasm and heroism of primitive beings, whom he 
further tends to resemble by the facility with which he allows 
himself to be impressed by words and images--which would be 
entirely without action on each of the isolated individuals 
composing the crowd--and to be induced to commit acts contrary to 
his most obvious interests and his best-known habits. An 
individual in a crowd is a grain of sand amid other grains of 
sand, which the wind stirs up at will. 
It is for these reasons that juries are seen to deliver verdicts 
of which each individual juror would disapprove, that 
parliamentary assemblies adopt laws and measures of which each of 
their members would disapprove in his own person. Taken 
separately, the men of the Convention were enlightened citizens 
of peaceful habits. United in a crowd, they did not hesitate to 
give their adhesion to the most savage proposals, to guillotine 
individuals most clearly innocent, and, contrary to their 
interests, to renounce their inviolability and to decimate 
themselves. 
It is not only by his acts that the individual in a crowd differs 
essentially from himself. Even before he has entirely lost his 
independence, his ideas and feelings have undergone a 
transformation, and the transformation is so profound as to 
change the miser into a spendthrift, the sceptic into a believer, 
the honest man into a criminal, and the coward into a hero. The 
renunciation of all its privileges which the nobility voted in a 
moment of enthusiasm during the celebrated night of August 4, 
1789, would certainly never have been consented to by any of its 
members taken singly. 
The conclusion to be drawn from what precedes is, that the crowd 
is always intellectually inferior to the isolated individual, but 
that, from the point of view of feelings and of the acts these 
feelings provoke, the crowd may, according to circumstances, he 
better or worse than the individual. All depends on the nature 
of the suggestion to which the crowd is exposed. This is the 
point that has been completely misunderstood by writers who have 
only studied crowds from the criminal point of view. Doubtless a 
crowd is often criminal, but also it is often heroic. It is 
crowds rather than isolated individuals that may be induced to 
run the risk of death to secure the triumph of a creed or an 
idea, that may be fired with enthusiasm for glory and honour, 
that are led on--almost without bread and without arms, as in the 
age of the Crusades--to deliver the tomb of Christ from the 
infidel, or, as in '93, to defend the fatherland. Such heroism 
is without doubt somewhat unconscious, but it is of such heroism 
that history is made. Were peoples only to be credited with the 
great actions performed in cold blood, the annals of the world 
would register but few of them. 
CHAPTER II 
THE SENTIMENTS AND MORALITY OF CROWDS 
1. IMPULSIVENESS, MOBILITY, AND IRRITABILITY OF CROWDS. 
The crowd is at the mercy of all exterior exciting causes, and 
reflects their incessant variations--The impulses which the crowd 
obeys are so imperious as to annihilate the feeling of personal 
interest-- Premeditation is absent from crowds--Racial influence. 
2. CROWDS ARE CREDULOUS AND READILY INFLUENCED BY 
SUGGESTION. The obedience of crowds to suggestions--The images 
evoked in the mind of crowds are accepted by them as 
realities--Why these images are identical for all the individuals 
composing a crowd--The equality of the educated and the ignorant 
man in a crowd--Various examples of the illusions to which the 
individuals in a crowd are subject--The impossibility of 
according belief to the testimony of crowds--The unanimity of 
numerous witnesses is one of the worst proofs that can be invoked 
to establish a fact--The slight value of works of history. 
3. THE EXAGGERATION AND INGENUOUSNESS OF THE SENTIMENTS OF 
CROWDS. Crowds do not admit doubt or uncertainty, and always go 
to extremes--Their sentiments always excessive.  4. THE 
INTOLERANCE, DICTATORIALNESS, AND CONSERVATISM OF CROWDS. The

progress.  5. THE MORALITY OF CROWDS. The morality of 
crowds, according to the suggestions under which they act, may be 
much lower or much higher than that of the individuals composing 
them--Explanation and examples-- Crowds rarely guided by those 
considerations of interest which are most often the exclusive 
motives of the isolated individual--The moralising role of 
crowds. 
Having indicated in a general way the principal characteristics 
of crowds, it remains to study these characteristics in detail. 
It will be remarked that among the special characteristics of 
crowds there are several--such as impulsiveness, irritability, 
incapacity to reason, the absence of judgment and of the critical 
spirit, the exaggeration of the sentiments, and others 
besides--which are almost always observed in beings belonging to 
inferior forms of evolution--in women, savages, and children, for 
instance. However, I merely indicate this analogy in passing; 
its demonstration is outside the scope of this work. It would, 
moreover, be useless for persons acquainted with the psychology 
of primitive beings, and would scarcely carry conviction to those 
in ignorance of this matter. 
I now proceed to the successive consideration of the different 
characteristics that may be observed in the majority of crowds. 
1. IMPULSIVENESS, MOBILITY, AND IRRITABILITY OF CROWDS. 
When studying the fundamental characteristics of a crowd we 
stated that it is guided almost exclusively by unconscious 
motives. Its acts are far more under the influence of the spinal 
cord than of the brain. In this respect a crowd is closely akin 
to quite primitive beings. The acts performed may be perfect so 
far as their execution is concerned, but as they are not directed 
by the brain, the individual conducts himself according as the 
exciting causes to which he is submitted may happen to decide. A 
crowd is at the mercy of all external exciting causes, and 
reflects their incessant variations. It is the slave of the 
impulses which it receives. The isolated individual may be 
submitted to the same exciting causes as the man in a crowd, but 
as his brain shows him the inadvisability of yielding to them, he 
refrains from yielding. This truth may be physiologically 
expressed by saying that the isolated individual possesses the 
capacity of dominating his reflex actions, while a crowd is 
devoid of this capacity. 
The varying impulses to which crowds obey may be, according to 
their exciting causes, generous or cruel, heroic or cowardly, but 
they will always be so imperious that the interest of the 
individual, even the interest of self-preservation, will not 
dominate them. The exciting causes that may act on crowds being 
so varied, and crowds always obeying them, crowds are in 
consequence extremely mobile. This explains how it is that we 
see them pass in a moment from the most bloodthirsty ferocity to 
the most extreme generosity and heroism. A crowd may easily 
enact the part of an executioner, but not less easily that of a 
martyr. It is crowds that have furnished the torrents of blood 
requisite for the triumph of every belief. It is not necessary 
to go back to the heroic ages to see what crowds are capable of 
in this latter direction. They are never sparing of their life 
in an insurrection, and not long since a general,[2] becoming 
suddenly popular, might easily have found a hundred thousand men 
ready to sacrifice their lives for his cause had he demanded it. 
[2] General Boulanger. 
Any display of premeditation by crowds is in consequence out of 
the question. They may be animated in succession by the most 
contrary sentiments, but they will always be under the influence 
of the exciting causes of the moment. They are like the leaves 
which a tempest whirls up and scatters in every direction and 
then allows to fall. When studying later on certain 
revolutionary crowds we shall give some examples of the 
variability of their sentiments. 
This mobility of crowds renders them very difficult to govern, 
especially when a measure of public authority has fallen into 
their hands. Did not the necessities of everyday life constitute 
a sort of invisible regulator of existence, it would scarcely be 
possible for democracies to last. Still, though the wishes of 
crowds are frenzied they are not durable. Crowds are as 
incapable of willing as of thinking for any length of time. 
A crowd is not merely impulsive and mobile. Like a savage, it is 
not prepared to admit that anything can come between its desire 
and the realisation of its desire. It is the less capable of 
understanding such an intervention, in consequence of the feeling 
of irresistible power given it by its numerical strength. The 
notion of impossibility disappears for the individual in a crowd. 
An isolated individual knows well enough that alone he cannot set 
fire to a palace or loot a shop, and should he be tempted to do 
so, he will easily resist the temptation. Making part of a 
crowd, he is conscious of the power given him by number, and it 
is sufficient to suggest to him ideas of murder or pillage for 
him to yield immediately to temptation. An unexpected obstacle 
will be destroyed with frenzied rage. Did the human organism 
allow of the perpetuity of furious passion, it might be said that 
the normal condition of a crowd baulked in its wishes is just 
such a state of furious passion. 
The fundamental characteristics of the race, which constitute the 
unvarying source from which all our sentiments spring, always 
exert an influence on the irritability of crowds, their 
impulsiveness and their mobility, as on all the popular 
sentiments we shall have to study. All crowds are doubtless 
always irritable and impulsive, but with great variations of 
degree. For instance, the difference between a Latin and an 
Anglo-Saxon crowd is striking. The most recent facts in French 
history throw a vivid light on this point. The mere publication, 
twenty-five years ago, of a telegram, relating an insult supposed 
to have been offered an ambassador, was sufficient to determine 
an explosion of fury, whence followed immediately a terrible war. 
Some years later the telegraphic announcement of an insignificant 
reverse at Langson provoked a fresh explosion which brought about 
the instantaneous overthrow of the government. At the same 
moment a much more serious reverse undergone by the English 
expedition to Khartoum produced only a slight emotion in England, 
and no ministry was overturned. Crowds are everywhere 
distinguished by feminine characteristics, but Latin crowds are 
the most feminine of all. Whoever trusts in them may rapidly 
attain a lofty destiny, but to do so is to be perpetually 
skirting the brink of a Tarpeian rock, with the certainty of one 
day being precipitated from it. 
2. THE SUGGESTIBILITY AND CREDULITY OF CROWDS. 
When defining crowds, we said that one of their general 
characteristics was an excessive suggestibility, and we have 
shown to what an extent suggestions are contagious in every human 
agglomeration; a fact which explains the rapid turning of the 
sentiments of a crowd in a definite direction. However 
indifferent it may be supposed, a crowd, as a rule, is in a state 
of expectant attention, which renders suggestion easy. The first 
suggestion formulated which arises implants itself immediately by 
a process of contagion in the brains of all assembled, and the 
identical bent of the sentiments of the crowd is immediately an 
accomplished fact. 
As is the case with all persons under the influence of 
suggestion, the idea which has entered the brain tends to 
transform itself into an act. Whether the act is that of setting 
fire to a palace, or involves self-sacrifice, a crowd lends 
itself to it with equal facility. All will depend on the nature 
of the exciting cause, and no longer, as in the case of the 
isolated individual, on the relations existing between the act 
suggested and the sum total of the reasons which may be urged 
against its realisation. 
In consequence, a crowd perpetually hovering on the borderland of 
unconsciousness, readily yielding to all suggestions, having all 
the violence of feeling peculiar to beings who cannot appeal to 
the influence of reason, deprived of all critical faculty, cannot 
be otherwise than excessively credulous. The improbable does not 
exist for a crowd, and it is necessary to bear this circumstance 
well in mind to understand the facility with which are created 
and propagated the most improbable legends and stories.[3] 
[3] Persons who went through the siege of Paris saw numerous 
examples of this credulity of crowds. A candle alight in an 
upper story was immediately looked upon as a signal given the 
besiegers, although it was evident, after a moment of reflection, 
that it was utterly impossible to catch sight of the light of the 
candle at a distance of several miles. 
The creation of the legends which so easily obtain circulation in 
crowds is not solely the consequence of their extreme credulity. 
It is also the result of the prodigious perversions that events 
undergo in the imagination of a throng. The simplest event that 
comes under the observation of a crowd is soon totally 
transformed. A crowd thinks in images, and the image itself 
immediately calls up a series of other images, having no logical 
connection with the first. We can easily conceive this state by 
thinking of the fantastic succession of ideas to which we are 
sometimes led by calling up in our minds any fact. Our reason 
shows us the incoherence there is in these images, but a crowd is 
almost blind to this truth, and confuses with the real event what 
the deforming action of its imagination has superimposed thereon. 
A crowd scarcely distinguishes between the subjective and the 
objective. It accepts as real the images evoked in its mind, 
though they most often have only a very distant relation with the 
observed fact. 
The ways in which a crowd perverts any event of which it is a 
witness ought, it would seem, to be innumerable and unlike each 
other, since the individuals composing the gathering are of very 
different temperaments. But this is not the case. As the result 
of contagion the perversions are of the same kind, and take the 
same shape in the case of all the assembled individuals. 
The first perversion of the truth effected by one of the 
individuals of the gathering is the starting-point of the 
contagious suggestion. Before St. George appeared on the walls 
of Jerusalem to all the Crusaders he was certainly perceived in 
the first instance by one of those present. By dint of 
suggestion and contagion the miracle signalised by a single 
person was immediately accepted by all. 
Such is always the mechanism of the collective hallucinations so 
frequent in history--hallucinations which seem to have all the 
recognised characteristics of authenticity, since they are 
phenomena observed by thousands of persons. 
To combat what precedes, the mental quality of the individuals 
composing a crowd must not be brought into consideration. This 
quality is without importance. From the moment that they form 
part of a crowd the learned man and the ignoramus are equally 
incapable of observation. 
This thesis may seem paradoxical. To demonstrate it beyond doubt 
it would be necessary to investigate a great number of historical 
facts, and several volumes would be insufficient for the purpose. 
Still, as I do not wish to leave the reader under the impression 
of unproved assertions, I shall give him some examples taken at 
hazard from the immense number of those that might be quoted. 
The following fact is one of the most typical, because chosen 
from among collective hallucinations of which a crowd is the 
victim, in which are to be found individuals of every kind, from 
the most ignorant to the most highly educated. It is related 
incidentally by Julian Felix, a naval lieutenant, in his book on 
""Sea Currents,"" and has been previously cited by the Revue 
Scientifique. 
The frigate, the Belle Poule, was cruising in the open sea for 
the purpose of finding the cruiser Le Berceau, from which she had 
been separated by a violent storm. It was broad daylight and in 
full sunshine. Suddenly the watch signalled a disabled vessel; 
the crew looked in the direction signalled, and every one, 
officers and sailors, clearly perceived a raft covered with men 
towed by boats which were displaying signals of distress. Yet 
this was nothing more than a collective hallucination. Admiral 
Desfosses lowered a boat to go to the rescue of the wrecked 
sailors. On nearing the object sighted, the sailors and officers 
on board the boat saw ""masses of men in motion, stretching out 
their hands, and heard the dull and confused noise of a great 
number of voices.""  When the object was reached those in the boat 
found themselves simply and solely in the presence of a few 
branches of trees covered with leaves that had been swept out 
from the neighbouring coast. Before evidence so palpable the 
hallucination vanished. 
The mechanism of a collective hallucination of the kind we have 
explained is clearly seen at work in this example. On the one 
hand we have a crowd in a state of expectant attention, on the 
other a suggestion made by the watch signalling a disabled vessel 
at sea, a suggestion which, by a process of contagion, was 
accepted by all those present, both officers and sailors. 
It is not necessary that a crowd should be numerous for the 
faculty of seeing what is taking place before its eyes to be 
destroyed and for the real facts to be replaced by hallucinations 
unrelated to them. As soon as a few individuals are gathered 
together they constitute a crowd, and, though they should be 
distinguished men of learning, they assume all the 
characteristics of crowds with regard to matters outside their 
speciality. The faculty of observation and the critical spirit 
possessed by each of them individually at once disappears. An 
ingenious psychologist, Mr. Davey, supplies us with a very 
curious example in point, recently cited in the Annales des 
Sciences Psychiques, and deserving of relation here. Mr. Davey, 
having convoked a gathering of distinguished observers, among 
them one of the most prominent of English scientific men, Mr. 
Wallace, executed in their presence, and after having allowed 
them to examine the objects and to place seals where they wished, 
all the regulation spiritualistic phenomena, the materialisation 
of spirits, writing on slates, &amp;c. Having subsequently obtained 
from these distinguished observers written reports admitting that 
the phenomena observed could only have been obtained by 
supernatural means, he revealed to them that they were the result 
of very simple tricks. ""The most astonishing feature of Monsieur 
Davey's investigation,"" writes the author of this account, ""is 
not the marvellousness of the tricks themselves, but the extreme 
weakness of the reports made with respect to them by the 
noninitiated witnesses. It is clear, then,"" he says, ""that 
witnesses even in number may give circumstantial relations which 
are completely erroneous, but whose result is THAT, IF THEIR 
DESCRIPTIONS ARE ACCEPTED AS EXACT, the phenomena they describe 
are inexplicable by trickery. The methods invented by Mr. Davey 
were so simple that one is astonished that he should have had the 
boldness to employ them; but he had such a power over the mind of 
the crowd that he could persuade it that it saw what it did not 
see.""  Here, as always, we have the power of the hypnotiser over 
the hypnotised. Moreover, when this power is seen in action on 
minds of a superior order and previously invited to be 
suspicious, it is understandable how easy it is to deceive 
ordinary crowds. 
Analogous examples are innumerable. As I write these lines the 
papers are full of the story of two little girls found drowned in 
the Seine. These children, to begin with, were recognised in the 
most unmistakable manner by half a dozen witnesses. All the 
affirmations were in such entire concordance that no doubt 
remained in the mind of the juge d'instruction. He had the 
certificate of death drawn up, but just as the burial of the 
children was to have been proceeded with, a mere chance brought 
about the discovery that the supposed victims were alive, and 
had, moreover, but a remote resemblance to the drowned girls. As 
in several of the examples previously cited, the affirmation of 
the first witness, himself a victim of illusion, had sufficed to 
influence the other witnesses. 
In parallel cases the starting-point of the suggestion is always 
the illusion produced in an individual by more or less vague 
reminiscences, contagion following as the result of the 
affirmation of this initial illusion. If the first observer be 
very impressionable, it will often be sufficient that the corpse 
he believes he recognises should present-- apart from all real 
resemblance--some peculiarity, a scar, or some detail of toilet 
which may evoke the idea of another person. The idea evoked may 
then become the nucleus of a sort of crystallisation which 
invades the understanding and paralyses all critical faculty. 
What the observer then sees is no longer the object itself, but 
the image evoked in his mind. In this way are to be explained 
erroneous recognitions of the dead bodies of children by their 
own mother, as occurred in the following case, already old, but 
which has been recently recalled by the newspapers. In it are to 
be traced precisely the two kinds of suggestion of which I have 
just pointed out the mechanism. 
""The child was recognised by another child, who was mistaken. 
The series of unwarranted recognitions then began. 
""An extraordinary thing occurred. The day after a schoolboy had 
recognised the corpse a woman exclaimed, `Good Heavens, it is my 
child!' 
""She was taken up to the corpse; she examined the clothing, and 
noted a scar on the forehead. `It is certainly,' she said, `my 
son who disappeared last July. He has been stolen from me and 
murdered.' 
""The woman was concierge in the Rue du Four; her name was 
Chavandret. Her brother-in-law was summoned, and when questioned 
he said, `That is the little Filibert.' Several persons living in 
the street recognised the child found at La Villette as Filibert 
Chavandret, among them being the boy's schoolmaster, who based 
his opinion on a medal worn by the lad. 
""Nevertheless, the neighbours, the brother-in-law, the 
schoolmaster, and the mother were mistaken. Six weeks later the 
identity of the child was established. The boy, belonging to 
Bordeaux, had been murdered there and brought by a carrying 
company to Paris.""[4] 
[4] L'Eclair, April 21, 1895. 
It will be remarked that these recognitions are most often made 
by women and children--that is to say, by precisely the most 
impressionable persons. They show us at the same time what is 
the worth in law courts of such witnesses. As far as children, 
more especially, are concerned, their statements ought never to 
be invoked. Magistrates are in the habit of repeating that 
children do not lie. Did they possess a psychological culture a 
little less rudimentary than is the case they would know that, on 
the contrary, children invariably lie; the lie is doubtless 
innocent, but it is none the less a lie. It would be better to 
decide the fate of an accused person by the toss of a coin than, 
as has been so often done, by the evidence of a child. 
To return to the faculty of observation possessed by crowds, our 
conclusion is that their collective observations are as erroneous 
as possible, and that most often they merely represent the 
illusion of an individual who, by a process of contagion, has 
suggestioned his fellows. Facts proving that the most utter 
mistrust of the evidence of crowds is advisable might be 
multiplied to any extent. Thousands of men were present 
twenty-five years ago at the celebrated cavalry charge during the 
battle of Sedan, and yet it is impossible, in the face of the 
most contradictory ocular testimony, to decide by whom it was 
commanded. The English general, Lord Wolseley, has proved in a 
recent book that up to now the gravest errors of fact have been 
committed with regard to the most important incidents of the 
battle of Waterloo--facts that hundreds of witnesses had 
nevertheless attested.[5] 
[5] Do we know in the case of one single battle exactly how it 
took place? I am very doubtful on the point. We know who were 
the conquerors and the conquered, but this is probably all. What 
M. D'Harcourt has said with respect to the battle of Solferino, 
which he witnessed and in which he was personally engaged, may be 
applied to all battles--""The generals (informed, of course, by 
the evidence of hundreds of witnesses) forward their official 
reports; the orderly officers modify these documents and draw up 
a definite narrative; the chief of the staff raises objections 
and re-writes the whole on a fresh basis. It is carried to the 
Marshal, who exclaims, `You are entirely in error,' and he 
substitutes a fresh edition. Scarcely anything remains of the 
original report.""  M. D'Harcourt relates this fact as proof of 
the impossibility of establishing the truth in connection with 
the most striking, the best observed events. 
Such facts show us what is the value of the testimony of crowds. 
Treatises on logic include the unanimity of numerous witnesses in 
the category of the strongest proofs that can be invoked in 
support of the exactness of a fact. Yet what we know of the 
psychology of crowds shows that treatises on logic need on this 
point to be rewritten. The events with regard to which there 
exists the most doubt are certainly those which have been 
observed by the greatest number of persons. To say that a fact 
has been simultaneously verified by thousands of witnesses is to 
say, as a rule, that the real fact is very different from the 
accepted account of it. 
It clearly results from what precedes that works of history must 
be considered as works of pure imagination. They are fanciful 
accounts of ill-observed facts, accompanied by explanations the 
result of reflection. To write such books is the most absolute 
waste of time. Had not the past left us its literary, artistic, 
and monumental works, we should know absolutely nothing in 
reality with regard to bygone times. Are we in possession of a 
single word of truth concerning the lives of the great men who 
have played preponderating parts in the history of humanity--men 
such as Hercules, Buddha, or Mahomet? In all probability we are 
not. In point of fact, moreover, their real lives are of slight 
importance to us. Our interest is to know what our great men 
were as they are presented by popular legend. It is legendary 
heroes, and not for a moment real heroes, who have impressed the 
minds of crowds. 
Unfortunately, legends--even although they have been definitely 
put on record by books--have in themselves no stability. The 
imagination of the crowd continually transforms them as the 
result of the lapse of time and especially in consequence of 
racial causes. There is a great gulf fixed between the 
sanguinary Jehovah of the Old Testament and the God of Love of 
Sainte Therese, and the Buddha worshipped in China has no traits 
in common with that venerated in India. 
It is not even necessary that heroes should be separated from us 
by centuries for their legend to be transformed by the 
imagination of the crowd. The transformation occasionally takes 
place within a few years. In our own day we have seen the legend 
of one of the greatest heroes of history modified several times 
in less than fifty years. Under the Bourbons Napoleon became a 
sort of idyllic and liberal philanthropist, a friend of the 
humble who, according to the poets, was destined to be long 
remembered in the cottage. Thirty years afterwards this 
easy-going hero had become a sanguinary despot, who, after having 
usurped power and destroyed liberty, caused the slaughter of 
three million men solely to satisfy his ambition. At present we 
are witnessing a fresh transformation of the legend. When it has 
undergone the influence of some dozens of centuries the learned 
men of the future, face to face with these contradictory 
accounts, will perhaps doubt the very existence of the hero, as 
some of them now doubt that of Buddha, and will see in him 
nothing more than a solar myth or a development of the legend of 
Hercules. They will doubtless console themselves easily for this 
uncertainty, for, better initiated than we are to-day in the 
characteristics and psychology of crowds, they will know that 
history is scarcely capable of preserving the memory of anything 
except myths. 
3. THE EXAGGERATION AND INGENUOUSNESS OF THE SENTIMENTS OF CROWDS. 
Whether the feelings exhibited by a crowd be good or bad, they 
present the double character of being very simple and very 
exaggerated. On this point, as on so many others, an individual 
in a crowd resembles primitive beings. Inaccessible to fine 
distinctions, he sees things as a whole, and is blind to their 
intermediate phases. The exaggeration of the sentiments of a 
crowd is heightened by the fact that any feeling when once it is 
exhibited communicating itself very quickly by a process of 
suggestion and contagion, the evident approbation of which it is 
the object considerably increases its force. 
The simplicity and exaggeration of the sentiments of crowds have 
for result that a throng knows neither doubt nor uncertainty. 
Like women, it goes at once to extremes. A suspicion transforms 
itself as soon as announced into incontrovertible evidence. A 
commencement of antipathy or disapprobation, which in the case of 
an isolated individual would not gain strength, becomes at once 
furious hatred in the case of an individual in a crowd. 
The violence of the feelings of crowds is also increased, 
especially in heterogeneous crowds, by the absence of all sense 
of responsibility. The certainty of impunity, a certainty the 
stronger as the crowd is more numerous, and the notion of a 
considerable momentary force due to number, make possible in the 
case of crowds sentiments and acts impossible for the isolated 
individual. In crowds the foolish, ignorant, and envious persons 
are freed from the sense of their insignificance and 
powerlessness, and are possessed instead by the notion of brutal 
and temporary but immense strength. 
Unfortunately, this tendency of crowds towards exaggeration is 
often brought to bear upon bad sentiments. These sentiments are 
atavistic residuum of the instincts of the primitive man, which 
the fear of punishment obliges the isolated and responsible 
individual to curb. Thus it is that crowds are so easily led 
into the worst excesses. 
Still this does not mean that crowds, skilfully influenced, are 
not capable of heroism and devotion and of evincing the loftiest 
virtues; they are even more capable of showing these qualities 
than the isolated individual. We shall soon have occasion to 
revert to this point when we come to study the morality of 
crowds. 
Given to exaggeration in its feelings, a crowd is only impressed 
by excessive sentiments. An orator wishing to move a crowd must 
make an abusive use of violent affirmations. To exaggerate, to 
affirm, to resort to repetitions, and never to attempt to prove 
anything by reasoning are methods of argument well known to 
speakers at public meetings. 
Moreover, a crowd exacts a like exaggeration in the sentiments of 
its heroes. Their apparent qualities and virtues must always be 
amplified. It has been justly remarked that on the stage a crowd 
demands from the hero of the piece a degree of courage, morality, 
and virtue that is never to be found in real life. 
Quite rightly importance has been laid on the special standpoint 
from which matters are viewed in the theatre. Such a standpoint 
exists no doubt, but its rules for the most part have nothing to 
do with common sense and logic. The art of appealing to crowds 
is no doubt of an inferior order, but it demands quite special 
aptitudes. It is often impossible on reading plays to explain 
their success. Managers of theatres when accepting pieces are 
themselves, as a rule, very uncertain of their success, because 
to judge the matter it would be necessary that they should be 
able to transform themselves into a crowd.[6] 
[6] It is understandable for this reason why it sometimes happens 
that pieces refused by all theatrical managers obtain a 
prodigious success when by a stroke of chance they are put on the 
stage. The recent success of Francois Coppee's play ""Pour la 
Couronne"" is well known, and yet, in spite of the name of its 
author, it was refused during ten years by the managers of the 
principal Parisian theatres. 
""Charley's Aunt,"" refused at every theatre, and finally staged at 
the expense of a stockbroker, has had two hundred representations 
in France, and more than a thousand in London. Without the 
explanation given above of the impossibility for theatrical 
managers to mentally substitute themselves for a crowd, such 
mistakes in judgment on the part of competent individuals, who 
are most interested not to commit such grave blunders, would be 
inexplicable. This is a subject that I cannot deal with here, 
but it might worthily tempt the pen of a writer acquainted with 
theatrical matters, and at the same time a subtle 
psychologist--of such a writer, for instance, as M. Francisque 
Sarcey. 
Here, once more, were we able to embark on more extensive 
explanations, we should show the preponderating influence of 
racial considerations. A play which provokes the enthusiasm of 
the crowd in one country has sometimes no success in another, or 
has only a partial and conventional success, because it does not 
put in operation influences capable of working on an altered 
public. 
I need not add that the tendency to exaggeration in crowds is 
only present in the case of sentiments and not at all in the 
matter of intelligence. I have already shown that, by the mere 
fact that an individual forms part of a crowd, his intellectual 
standard is immediately and considerably lowered. A learned 
magistrate, M. Tarde, has also verified this fact in his 
researches on the crimes of crowds. It is only, then, with 
respect to sentiment that crowds can rise to a very high or, on 
the contrary, descend to a very low level. 
4. THE INTOLERANCE, DICTATORIALNESS AND CONSERVATISM OF CROWDS. 
Crowds are only cognisant of simple and extreme sentiments; the 
opinions, ideas, and beliefs suggested to them are accepted or 
rejected as a whole, and considered as absolute truths or as not 
less absolute errors. This is always the case with beliefs 
induced by a process of suggestion instead of engendered by 
reasoning. Every one is aware of the intolerance that 
accompanies religious beliefs, and of the despotic empire they 
exercise on men's minds. 
Being in doubt as to what constitutes truth or error, and having, 
on the other hand, a clear notion of its strength, a crowd is as 
disposed to give authoritative effect to its inspirations as it 
is intolerant. An individual may accept contradiction and 
discussion; a crowd will never do so. At public meetings the 
slightest contradiction on the part of an orator is immediately 
received with howls of fury and violent invective, soon followed 
by blows, and expulsion should the orator stick to his point. 
Without the restraining presence of the representatives of 
authority the contradictor, indeed, would often be done to death. 
Dictatorialness and intolerance are common to all categories of 
crowds, but they are met with in a varying degree of intensity. 
Here, once more, reappears that fundamental notion of race which 
dominates all the feelings and all the thoughts of men. It is 
more especially in Latin crowds that authoritativeness and 
intolerance are found developed in the highest measure. In fact, 
their development is such in crowds of Latin origin that they 
have entirely destroyed that sentiment of the independence of the 
individual so powerful in the Anglo-Saxon. Latin crowds are only 
concerned with the collective independence of the sect to which 
they belong, and the characteristic feature of their conception 
of independence is the need they experience of bringing those who 
are in disagreement with themselves into immediate and violent 
subjection to their beliefs. Among the Latin races the Jacobins 
of every epoch, from those of the Inquisition downwards, have 
never been able to attain to a different conception of liberty. 
Authoritativeness and intolerance are sentiments of which crowds 
have a very clear notion, which they easily conceive and which 
they entertain as readily as they put them in practice when once 
they are imposed upon them. Crowds exhibit a docile respect for 
force, and are but slightly impressed by kindness, which for them 
is scarcely other than a form of weakness. Their sympathies have 
never been bestowed on easy-going masters, but on tyrants who 
vigorously oppressed them. It is to these latter that they 
always erect the loftiest statues. It is true that they 
willingly trample on the despot whom they have stripped of his 
power, but it is because, having lost his strength, he has 
resumed his place among the feeble, who are to be despised 
because they are not to be feared. The type of hero dear to 
crowds will always have the semblance of a Caesar. His insignia 
attracts them, his authority overawes them, and his sword instils 
them with fear. 
A crowd is always ready to revolt against a feeble, and to bow 
down servilely before a strong authority. Should the strength of 
an authority be intermittent, the crowd, always obedient to its 
extreme sentiments, passes alternately from anarchy to servitude, 
and from servitude to anarchy. 
However, to believe in the predominance among crowds of 
revolutionary instincts would be to entirely misconstrue their 
psychology. It is merely their tendency to violence that 
deceives us on this point. Their rebellious and destructive 
outbursts are always very transitory. Crowds are too much 
governed by unconscious considerations, and too much subject in 
consequence to secular hereditary influences not to be extremely 
conservative. Abandoned to themselves, they soon weary of 
disorder, and instinctively turn to servitude. It was the 
proudest and most untractable of the Jacobins who acclaimed 
Bonaparte with greatest energy when he suppressed all liberty and 
made his hand of iron severely felt. 
It is difficult to understand history, and popular revolutions in 
particular, if one does not take sufficiently into account the 
profoundly conservative instincts of crowds. They may be 
desirous, it is true, of changing the names of their 
institutions, and to obtain these changes they accomplish at 
times even violent revolutions, but the essence of these 
institutions is too much the expression of the hereditary needs 
of the race for them not invariably to abide by it. Their 
incessant mobility only exerts its influence on quite superficial 
matters. In fact they possess conservative instincts as 
indestructible as those of all primitive beings. Their fetish- 
like respect for all traditions is absolute; their unconscious 
horror of all novelty capable of changing the essential 
conditions of their existence is very deeply rooted. Had 
democracies possessed the power they wield to-day at the time of 
the invention of mechanical looms or of the introduction of 
steam-power and of railways, the realisation of these inventions 
would have been impossible, or would have been achieved at the 
cost of revolutions and repeated massacres. It is fortunate for 
the progress of civilisation that the power of crowds only began 
to exist when the great discoveries of science and industry had 
already been effected. 
5. THE MORALITY OF CROWDS. 
Taking the word ""morality"" to mean constant respect for certain 
social conventions, and the permanent repression of selfish 
impulses, it is quite evident that crowds are too impulsive and 
too mobile to be moral. If, however, we include in the term 
morality the transitory display of certain qualities such as 
abnegation, self-sacrifice, disinterestedness, devotion, and the 
need of equity, we may say, on the contrary, that crowds may 
exhibit at times a very lofty morality. 
The few psychologists who have studied crowds have only 
considered them from the point of view of their criminal acts, 
and noticing how frequent these acts are, they have come to the 
conclusion that the moral standard of crowds is very low. 
Doubtless this is often the case; but why? Simply because our 
savage, destructive instincts are the inheritance left dormant in 
all of us from the primitive ages. In the life of the isolated 
individual it would be dangerous for him to gratify these 
instincts, while his absorption in an irresponsible crowd, in 
which in consequence he is assured of impunity, gives him entire 
liberty to follow them. Being unable, in the ordinary course of 
events, to exercise these destructive instincts on our fellow- 
men, we confine ourselves to exercising them on animals. The 
passion, so widespread, for the chase and the acts of ferocity of 
crowds proceed from one and the same source. A crowd which 
slowly slaughters a defenceless victim displays a very cowardly 
ferocity; but for the philosopher this ferocity is very closely 
related to that of the huntsmen who gather in dozens for the 
pleasure of taking part in the pursuit and killing of a luckless 
stag by their hounds. 
A crowd may be guilty of murder, incendiarism, and every kind of 
crime, but it is also capable of very lofty acts of devotion, 
sacrifice, and disinterestedness, of acts much loftier indeed 
than those of which the isolated individual is capable. Appeals 
to sentiments of glory, honour, and patriotism are particularly 
likely to influence the individual forming part of a crowd, and 
often to the extent of obtaining from him the sacrifice of his 
life. History is rich in examples analogous to those furnished 
by the Crusaders and the volunteers of 1793. Collectivities 
alone are capable of great disinterestedness and great devotion. 
How numerous are the crowds that have heroically faced death for 
beliefs, ideas, and phrases that they scarcely understood! The 
crowds that go on strike do so far more in obedience to an order 
than to obtain an increase of the slender salary with which they 
make shift. Personal interest is very rarely a powerful motive 
force with crowds, while it is almost the exclusive motive of the 
conduct of the isolated individual. It is assuredly not 
self-interest that has guided crowds in so many wars, 
incomprehensible as a rule to their intelligence--wars in which 
they have allowed themselves to be massacred as easily as the 
larks hypnotised by the mirror of the hunter. 
Even in the case of absolute scoundrels it often happens that the 
mere fact of their being in a crowd endows them for the moment 
with very strict principles of morality. Taine calls attention 
to the fact that the perpetrators of the September massacres 
deposited on the table of the committees the pocket-books and 
jewels they had found on their victims, and with which they could 
easily have been able to make away. The howling, swarming, 
ragged crowd which invaded the Tuileries during the revolution of 
1848 did not lay hands on any of the objects that excited its 
astonishment, and one of which would have meant bread for many 
days. 
This moralisation of the individual by the crowd is not certainly 
a constant rule, but it is a rule frequently observed. It is 
even observed in circumstances much less grave than those I have 
just cited. I have remarked that in the theatre a crowd exacts 
from the hero of the piece exaggerated virtues, and it is a 
commonplace observation that an assembly, even though composed of 
inferior elements, shows itself as a rule very prudish. The 
debauchee, the souteneur, the rough often break out into murmurs 
at a slightly risky scene or expression, though they be very 
harmless in comparison with their customary conversation. 
If, then, crowds often abandon themselves to low instincts, they 
also set the example at times of acts of lofty morality. If 
disinterestedness, resignation, and absolute devotion to a real 
or chimerical ideal are moral virtues, it may be said that crowds 
often possess these virtues to a degree rarely attained by the 
wisest philosophers. Doubtless they practice them unconsciously, 
but that is of small import. We should not complain too much 
that crowds are more especially guided by unconscious 
considerations and are not given to reasoning. Had they, in 
certain cases, reasoned and consulted their immediate interests, 
it is possible that no civilisation would have grown up on our 
planet and humanity would have had no history. 
CHAPTER III 
THE IDEAS, REASONING POWER, AND IMAGINATION OF CROWDS 
1. THE IDEAS OF CROWDS. Fundamental and accessory 
ideas--How contradictory ideas may exist simultaneously--The 
transformation that must be undergone by lofty ideas before they 
are accessible to crowds-- The social influence of ideas is 
independent of the degree of truth they may contain.  2. THE 
REASONING POWER OF CROWDS. Crowds are not to be influenced by 
reasoning--The reasoning of crowds is always of a very inferior 
order--There is only the appearance of analogy or succession in 
the ideas they associate.  3. THE IMAGINATION OF CROWDS. 
Strength of the imagination of crowds--Crowds think in images, 
and these images succeed each other without any connecting 
link--Crowds are especially impressed by the marvellous--Legends 
and the marvellous are the real pillars of civilisation--The 
popular imagination has always been the basis of the power of 
statesmen--The manner in which facts capable of striking the 
imagination of crowds present themselves for observation. 
1. THE IDEAS OF CROWDS 
WHEN studying in a preceding work the part played by ideas in the 
evolution of nations, we showed that every civilisation is the 
outcome of a small number of fundamental ideas that are very 
rarely renewed. We showed how these ideas are implanted in the 
minds of crowds, with what difficulty the process is effected, 
and the power possessed by the ideas in question when once it has 
been accomplished. Finally we saw that great historical 
perturbations are the result, as a rule, of changes in these 
fundamental ideas. 
Having treated this subject at sufficient length, I shall not 
return to it now, but shall confine myself to saying a few words 
on the subject of such ideas as are accessible to crowds, and of 
the forms under which they conceive them. 
They may be divided into two classes. In one we shall place 
accidental and passing ideas created by the influences of the 
moment: infatuation for an individual or a doctrine, for 
instance. In the other will be classed the fundamental ideas, to 
which the environment, the laws of heredity and public opinion 
give a very great stability; such ideas are the religious beliefs 
of the past and the social and democratic ideas of to-day. 
These fundamental ideas resemble the volume of the water of a 
stream slowly pursuing its course; the transitory ideas are like 
the small waves, for ever changing, which agitate its surface, 
and are more visible than the progress of the stream itself 
although without real importance. 
At the present day the great fundamental ideas which were the 
mainstay of our fathers are tottering more and more. They have 
lost all solidity, and at the same time the institutions resting 
upon them are severely shaken. Every day there are formed a 
great many of those transitory minor ideas of which I have just 
been speaking; but very few of them to all appearance seem 
endowed with vitality and destined to acquire a preponderating 
influence. 
Whatever be the ideas suggested to crowds they can only exercise 
effective influence on condition that they assume a very 
absolute, uncompromising, and simple shape. They present 
themselves then in the guise of images, and are only accessible 
to the masses under this form. These imagelike ideas are not 
connected by any logical bond of analogy or succession, and may 
take each other's place like the slides of a magic-lantern which 
the operator withdraws from the groove in which they were placed 
one above the other. This explains how it is that the most 
contradictory ideas may be seen to be simultaneously current in 
crowds. According to the chances of the moment, a crowd will 
come under the influence of one of the various ideas stored up in 
its understanding, and is capable, in consequence, of committing 
the most dissimilar acts. Its complete lack of the critical 
spirit does not allow of its perceiving these contradictions. 
This phenomenon is not peculiar to crowds. It is to be observed 
in many isolated individuals, not only among primitive beings, 
but in the case of all those--the fervent sectaries of a 
religious faith, for instance--who by one side or another of 
their intelligence are akin to primitive beings. I have observed 
its presence to a curious extent in the case of educated Hindoos 
brought up at our European universities and having taken their 
degree. A number of Western ideas had been superposed on their 
unchangeable and fundamental hereditary or social ideas. 
According to the chances of the moment, the one or the other set 
of ideas showed themselves each with their special accompaniment 
of acts or utterances, the same individual presenting in this way 
the most flagrant contradictions. These contradictions are more 
apparent than real, for it is only hereditary ideas that have 
sufficient influence over the isolated individual to become 
motives of conduct. It is only when, as the result of the 
intermingling of different races, a man is placed between 
different hereditary tendencies that his acts from one moment to 
another may be really entirely contradictory. It would be 
useless to insist here on these phenomena, although their 
psychological importance is capital. I am of opinion that at 
least ten years of travel and observation would be necessary to 
arrive at a comprehension of them. 
Ideas being only accessible to crowds after having assumed a very 
simple shape must often undergo the most thoroughgoing 
transformations to become popular. It is especially when we are 
dealing with somewhat lofty philosophic or scientific ideas that 
we see how far-reaching are the modifications they require in 
order to lower them to the level of the intelligence of crowds. 
These modifications are dependent on the nature of the crowds, or 
of the race to which the crowds belong, but their tendency is 
always belittling and in the direction of simplification. This 
explains the fact that, from the social point of view, there is 
in reality scarcely any such thing as a hierarchy of ideas--that 
is to say, as ideas of greater or less elevation. However great 
or true an idea may have been to begin with, it is deprived of 
almost all that which constituted its elevation and its greatness 
by the mere fact that it has come within the intellectual range 
of crowds and exerts an influence upon them. 
Moreover, from the social point of view the hierarchical value of 
an idea, its intrinsic worth, is without importance. The 
necessary point to consider is the effects it produces. The 
Christian ideas of the Middle Ages, the democratic ideas of the 
last century, or the social ideas of to-day are assuredly not 
very elevated. Philosophically considered, they can only be 
regarded as somewhat sorry errors, and yet their power has been 
and will be immense, and they will count for a long time to come 
among the most essential factors that determine the conduct of 
States. 
Even when an idea has undergone the transformations which render 
it accessible to crowds, it only exerts influence when, by 
various processes which we shall examine elsewhere, it has 
entered the domain of the unconscious, when indeed it has become 
a sentiment, for which much time is required. 
For it must not be supposed that merely because the justness of 
an idea has been proved it can be productive of effective action 
even on cultivated minds. This fact may be quickly appreciated 
by noting how slight is the influence of the clearest 
demonstration on the majority of men. Evidence, if it be very 
plain, may be accepted by an educated person, but the convert 
will be quickly brought back by his unconscious self to his 
original conceptions. See him again after the lapse of a few 
days and he will put forward afresh his old arguments in exactly 
the same terms. He is in reality under the influence of anterior 
ideas, that have become sentiments, and it is such ideas alone 
that influence the more recondite motives of our acts and 
utterances. It cannot be otherwise in the case of crowds. 
When by various processes an idea has ended by penetrating into 
the minds of crowds, it possesses an irresistible power, and 
brings about a series of effects, opposition to which is 
bootless. The philosophical ideas which resulted in the French 
Revolution took nearly a century to implant themselves in the 
mind of the crowd. Their irresistible force, when once they had 
taken root, is known. The striving of an entire nation towards 
the conquest of social equality, and the realisation of abstract 
rights and ideal liberties, caused the tottering of all thrones 
and profoundly disturbed the Western world. During twenty years 
the nations were engaged in internecine conflict, and Europe 
witnessed hecatombs that would have terrified Ghengis Khan and 
Tamerlane. The world had never seen on such a scale what may 
result from the promulgation of an idea. 
A long time is necessary for ideas to establish themselves in the 
minds of crowds, but just as long a time is needed for them to be 
eradicated. For this reason crowds, as far as ideas are 
concerned, are always several generations behind learned men and 
philosophers. All statesmen are well aware to-day of the 
admixture of error contained in the fundamental ideas I referred 
to a short while back, but as the influence of these ideas is 
still very powerful they are obliged to govern in accordance with 
principles in the truth of which they have ceased to believe. 
2. THE REASONING POWER OF CROWDS 
It cannot absolutely be said that crowds do not reason and are 
not to be influenced by reasoning. 
However, the arguments they employ and those which are capable of 
influencing them are, from a logical point of view, of such an 
inferior kind that it is only by way of analogy that they can be 
described as reasoning. 
The inferior reasoning of crowds is based, just as is reasoning 
of a high order, on the association of ideas, but between the 
ideas associated by crowds there are only apparent bonds of 
analogy or succession. The mode of reasoning of crowds resembles 
that of the Esquimaux who, knowing from experience that ice, a 
transparent body, melts in the mouth, concludes that glass, also 
a transparent body, should also melt in the mouth; or that of the 
savage who imagines that by eating the heart of a courageous foe 
he acquires his bravery; or of the workman who, having been 
exploited by one employer of labour, immediately concludes that 
all employers exploit their men. 
The characteristics of the reasoning of crowds are the 
association of dissimilar things possessing a merely apparent 
connection between each other, and the immediate generalisation 
of particular cases. It is arguments of this kind that are 
always presented to crowds by those who know how to manage them. 
They are the only arguments by which crowds are to be influenced. 
A chain of logical argumentation is totally incomprehensible to 
crowds, and for this reason it is permissible to say that they do 
not reason or that they reason falsely and are not to be 
influenced by reasoning. Astonishment is felt at times on 
reading certain speeches at their weakness, and yet they had an 
enormous influence on the crowds which listened to them, but it 
is forgotten that they were intended to persuade collectivities 
and not to be read by philosophers. An orator in intimate 
communication with a crowd can evoke images by which it will be 
seduced. If he is successful his object has been attained, and 
twenty volumes of harangues--always the outcome of 
reflection--are not worth the few phrases which appealed to the 
brains it was required to convince. 
It would be superfluous to add that the powerlessness of crowds 
to reason aright prevents them displaying any trace of the 
critical spirit, prevents them, that is, from being capable of 
discerning truth from error, or of forming a precise judgment on 
any matter. Judgments accepted by crowds are merely judgments 
forced upon them and never judgments adopted after discussion. 
In regard to this matter the individuals who do not rise above 
the level of a crowd are numerous. The ease with which certain 
opinions obtain general acceptance results more especially from 
the impossibility experienced by the majority of men of forming 
an opinion peculiar to themselves and based on reasoning of their 
own. 
3. THE IMAGINATION OF CROWDS 
Just as is the case with respect to persons in whom the reasoning 
power is absent, the figurative imagination of crowds is very 
powerful, very active and very susceptible of being keenly 
impressed. The images evoked in their mind by a personage, an 
event, an accident, are almost as lifelike as the reality. 
Crowds are to some extent in the position of the sleeper whose 
reason, suspended for the time being, allows the arousing in his 
mind of images of extreme intensity which would quickly be 
dissipated could they be submitted to the action of reflection. 
Crowds, being incapable both of reflection and of reasoning, are 
devoid of the notion of improbability; and it is to be noted that 
in a general way it is the most improbable things that are the 
most striking. 
This is why it happens that it is always the marvellous and 
legendary side of events that more specially strike crowds. When 
a civilisation is analysed it is seen that, in reality, it is the 
marvellous and the legendary that are its true supports. 
Appearances have always played a much more important part than 
reality in history, where the unreal is always of greater moment 
than the real. 
Crowds being only capable of thinking in images are only to be 
impressed by images. It is only images that terrify or attract 
them and become motives of action. 
For this reason theatrical representations, in which the image is 
shown in its most clearly visible shape, always have an enormous 
influence on crowds. Bread and spectacular shows constituted for 
the plebeians of ancient Rome the ideal of happiness, and they 
asked for nothing more. Throughout the successive ages this 
ideal has scarcely varied. Nothing has a greater effect on the 
imagination of crowds of every category than theatrical 
representations. The entire audience experiences at the same 
time the same emotions, and if these emotions are not at once 
transformed into acts, it is because the most unconscious 
spectator cannot ignore that he is the victim of illusions, and 
that he has laughed or wept over imaginary adventures. 
Sometimes, however, the sentiments suggested by the images are so 
strong that they tend, like habitual suggestions, to transform 
themselves into acts. The story has often been told of the 
manager of a popular theatre who, in consequence of his only 
playing sombre dramas, was obliged to have the actor who took the 
part of the traitor protected on his leaving the theatre, to 
defend him against the violence of the spectators, indignant at 
the crimes, imaginary though they were, which the traitor had 
committed. We have here, in my opinion, one of the most 
remarkable indications of the mental state of crowds, and 
especially of the facility with which they are suggestioned. The 
unreal has almost as much influence on them as the real. They 
have an evident tendency not to distinguish between the two. 
The power of conquerors and the strength of States is based on 
the popular imagination. It is more particularly by working upon 
this imagination that crowds are led. All great historical 
facts, the rise of Buddhism, of Christianity, of Islamism, the 
Reformation, the French Revolution, and, in our own time, the 
threatening invasion of Socialism are the direct or indirect 
consequences of strong impressions produced on the imagination of 
the crowd. 
Moreover, all the great statesmen of every age and every country, 
including the most absolute despots, have regarded the popular 
imagination as the basis of their power, and they have never 
attempted to govern in opposition to it ""It was by becoming a 
Catholic,"" said Napoleon to the Council of State, ""that I 
terminated the Vendeen war. By becoming a Mussulman that I 
obtained a footing in Egypt. By becoming an Ultramontane that I 
won over the Italian priests, and had I to govern a nation of 
Jews I would rebuild Solomon's temple.""  Never perhaps since 
Alexander and Caesar has any great man better understood how the 
imagination of the crowd should be impressed. His constant 
preoccupation was to strike it. He bore it in mind in his 
victories, in his harangues, in his speeches, in all his acts. 
On his deathbed it was still in his thoughts. 
How is the imagination of crowds to be impressed? We shall soon 
see. Let us confine ourselves for the moment to saying that the 
feat is never to be achieved by attempting to work upon the 
intelligence or reasoning faculty, that is to say, by way of 
demonstration. It was not by means of cunning rhetoric that 
Antony succeeded in making the populace rise against the 
murderers of Caesar; it was by reading his will to the multitude 
and pointing to his corpse. 
Whatever strikes the imagination of crowds presents itself under 
the shape of a startling and very clear image, freed from all 
accessory explanation, or merely having as accompaniment a few 
marvellous or mysterious facts: examples in point are a great 
victory, a great miracle, a great crime, or a great hope. Things 
must be laid before the crowd as a whole, and their genesis must 
never be indicated. A hundred petty crimes or petty accidents 
will not strike the imagination of crowds in the least, whereas a 
single great crime or a single great accident will profoundly 
impress them, even though the results be infinitely less 
disastrous than those of the hundred small accidents put 
together. The epidemic of influenza, which caused the death but 
a few years ago of five thousand persons in Paris alone, made 
very little impression on the popular imagination. The reason 
was that this veritable hecatomb was not embodied in any visible 
image, but was only learnt from statistical information furnished 
weekly. An accident which should have caused the death of only 
five hundred instead of five thousand persons, but on the same 
day and in public, as the outcome of an accident appealing 
strongly to the eye, by the fall, for instance, of the Eiffel 
Tower, would have produced, on the contrary, an immense 
impression on the imagination of the crowd. The probable loss of 
a transatlantic steamer that was supposed, in the absence of 
news, to have gone down in mid-ocean profoundly impressed the 
imagination of the crowd for a whole week. Yet official 
statistics show that 850 sailing vessels and 203 steamers were 
lost in the year 1894 alone. The crowd, however, was never for a 
moment concerned by these successive losses, much more important 
though they were as far as regards the destruction of life and 
property, than the loss of the Atlantic liner in question could 
possibly have been. 
It is not, then, the facts in themselves that strike the popular 
imagination, but the way in which they take place and are brought 
under notice. It is necessary that by their condensation, if I 
may thus express myself, they should produce a startling image 
which fills and besets the mind. To know the art of impressing 
the imagination of crowds is to know at the same time the art of 
governing them. 
CHAPTER IV 
A RELIGIOUS SHAPE ASSUMED BY ALL THE CONVICTIONS OF CROWDS 
What is meant by the religious sentiment--It is independent of 
the worship of a divinity--Its characteristics--The strength of 
convictions assuming a religious shape--Various examples--Popular 
gods have never disappeared--New forms under which they are 
revived--Religious forms of atheism--Importance of these notions 
from the historical point of view-- The Reformation, Saint 
Bartholomew, the Terror, and all analogous events are the result 
of the religious sentiments of crowds and not of the will of 
isolated individuals. 
We have shown that crowds do not reason, that they accept or 
reject ideas as a whole, that they tolerate neither discussion 
nor contradiction, and that the suggestions brought to bear on 
them invade the entire field of their understanding and tend at 
once to transform themselves into acts. We have shown that 
crowds suitably influenced are ready to sacrifice themselves for 
the ideal with which they have been inspired. We have also seen 
that they only entertain violent and extreme sentiments, that in 
their case sympathy quickly becomes adoration, and antipathy 
almost as soon as it is aroused is transformed into hatred. 
These general indications furnish us already with a presentiment 
of the nature of the convictions of crowds. 
When these convictions are closely examined, whether at epochs 
marked by fervent religious faith, or by great political 
upheavals such as those of the last century, it is apparent that 
they always assume a peculiar form which I cannot better define 
than by giving it the name of a religious sentiment. 
This sentiment has very simple characteristics, such as worship 
of a being supposed superior, fear of the power with which the 
being is credited, blind submission to its commands, inability to 
discuss its dogmas, the desire to spread them, and a tendency to 
consider as enemies all by whom they are not accepted. Whether 
such a sentiment apply to an invisible God, to a wooden or stone 
idol, to a hero or to a political conception, provided that it 
presents the preceding characteristics, its essence always 
remains religious. The supernatural and the miraculous are found 
to be present to the same extent. Crowds unconsciously accord a 
mysterious power to the political formula or the victorious 
leader that for the moment arouses their enthusiasm. 
A person is not religious solely when he worships a divinity, but 
when he puts all the resources of his mind, the complete 
submission of his will, and the whole-souled ardour of fanaticism 
at the service of a cause or an individual who becomes the goal 
and guide of his thoughts and actions. 
Intolerance and fanaticism are the necessary accompaniments of 
the religious sentiment. They are inevitably displayed by those 
who believe themselves in the possession of the secret of earthly 
or eternal happiness. These two characteristics are to be found 
in all men grouped together when they are inspired by a 
conviction of any kind. The Jacobins of the Reign of Terror were 
at bottom as religious as the Catholics of the Inquisition, and 
their cruel ardour proceeded from the same source. 
The convictions of crowds assume those characteristics of blind 
submission, fierce intolerance, and the need of violent 
propaganda which are inherent in the religious sentiment, and it 
is for this reason that it may be said that all their beliefs 
have a religious form. The hero acclaimed by a crowd is a 
veritable god for that crowd. Napoleon was such a god for 
fifteen years, and a divinity never had more fervent worshippers 
or sent men to their death with greater ease. The Christian and 
Pagan Gods never exercised a more absolute empire over the minds 
that had fallen under their sway. 
All founders of religious or political creeds have established 
them solely because they were successful in inspiring crowds with 
those fanatical sentiments which have as result that men find 
their happiness in worship and obedience and are ready to lay 
down their lives for their idol. This has been the case at all 
epochs. Fustel de Coulanges, in his excellent work on Roman 
Gaul, justly remarks that the Roman Empire was in no wise 
maintained by force, but by the religious admiration it inspired. 
""It would be without a parallel in the history of the world,"" he 
observes rightly, ""that a form of government held in popular 
detestation should have lasted for five centuries. . . . It 
would be inexplicable that the thirty legions of the Empire 
should have constrained a hundred million men to obedience.""  The 
reason of their obedience was that the Emperor, who personified 
the greatness of Rome, was worshipped like a divinity by 
unanimous consent. There were altars in honour of the Emperor in 
the smallest townships of his realm. ""From one end of the Empire 
to the other a new religion was seen to arise in those days which 
had for its divinities the emperors themselves. Some years 
before the Christian era the whole of Gaul, represented by sixty 
cities, built in common a temple near the town of Lyons in honour 
of Augustus. . . . Its priests, elected by the united Gallic 
cities, were the principal personages in their country. . . . It 
is impossible to attribute all this to fear and servility. Whole 
nations are not servile, and especially for three centuries. It 
was not the courtiers who worshipped the prince, it was Rome, and 
it was not Rome merely, but it was Gaul, it was Spain, it was 
Greece and Asia."" 
To-day the majority of the great men who have swayed men's minds 
no longer have altars, but they have statues, or their portraits 
are in the hands of their admirers, and the cult of which they 
are the object is not notably different from that accorded to 
their predecessors. An understanding of the philosophy of 
history is only to be got by a thorough appreciation of this 
fundamental point of the psychology of crowds. The crowd demands 
a god before everything else. 
It must not be supposed that these are the superstitions of a 
bygone age which reason has definitely banished. Sentiment has 
never been vanquished in its eternal conflict with reason. 
Crowds will hear no more of the words divinity and religion, in 
whose name they were so long enslaved; but they have never 
possessed so many fetishes as in the last hundred years, and the 
old divinities have never had so many statues and altars raised 
in their honour. Those who in recent years have studied the 
popular movement known under the name of Boulangism have been 
able to see with what ease the religious instincts of crowds are 
ready to revive. There was not a country inn that did not 
possess the hero's portrait. He was credited with the power of 
remedying all injustices and all evils, and thousands of men 
would have given their lives for him. Great might have been his 
place in history had his character been at all on a level with 
his legendary reputation. 
It is thus a very useless commonplace to assert that a religion 
is necessary for the masses, because all political, divine, and 
social creeds only take root among them on the condition of 
always assuming the religious shape--a shape which obviates the 
danger of discussion. Were it possible to induce the masses to 
adopt atheism, this belief would exhibit all the intolerant 
ardour of a religious sentiment, and in its exterior forms would 
soon become a cult. The evolution of the small Positivist sect 
furnishes us a curious proof in point. What happened to the 
Nihilist whose story is related by that profound thinker 
Dostoiewsky has quickly happened to the Positivists. Illumined 
one day by the light of reason he broke the images of divinities 
and saints that adorned the altar of a chapel, extinguished the 
candles, and, without losing a moment, replaced the destroyed 
objects by the works of atheistic philosophers such as Buchner 
and Moleschott, after which he piously relighted the candles. 
The object of his religious beliefs had been transformed, but can 
it be truthfully said that his religious sentiments had changed? 
Certain historical events--and they are precisely the most 
important--I again repeat, are not to be understood unless one 
has attained to an appreciation of the religious form which the 
convictions of crowds always assume in the long run. There are 
social phenomena that need to be studied far more from the point 
of view of the psychologist than from that of the naturalist. 
The great historian Taine has only studied the Revolution as a 
naturalist, and on this account the real genesis of events has 
often escaped him. He has perfectly observed the facts, but from 
want of having studied the psychology of crowds he has not always 
been able to trace their causes. The facts having appalled him 
by their bloodthirsty, anarchic, and ferocious side, he has 
scarcely seen in the heroes of the great drama anything more than 
a horde of epileptic savages abandoning themselves without 
restraint to their instincts. The violence of the Revolution, 
its massacres, its need of propaganda, its declarations of war 
upon all things, are only to be properly explained by reflecting 
that the Revolution was merely the establishment of a new 
religious belief in the mind of the masses. The Reformation, the 
massacre of Saint Bartholomew, the French religious wars, the 
Inquisition, the Reign of Terror are phenomena of an identical 
kind, brought about by crowds animated by those religious 
sentiments which necessarily lead those imbued with them to 
pitilessly extirpate by fire and sword whoever is opposed to the 
establishment of the new faith. The methods of the Inquisition 
are those of all whose convictions are genuine and sturdy. Their 
convictions would not deserve these epithets did they resort to 
other methods. 
Upheavals analogous to those I have just cited are only possible 
when it is the soul of the masses that brings them about. The 
most absolute despots could not cause them. When historians tell 
us that the massacre of Saint Bartholomew was the work of a king, 
they show themselves as ignorant of the psychology of crowds as 
of that of sovereigns. Manifestations of this order can only 
proceed from the soul of crowds. The most absolute power of the 
most despotic monarch can scarcely do more than hasten or retard 
the moment of their apparition. The massacre of Saint 
Bartholomew or the religious wars were no more the work of kings 
than the Reign of Terror was the work of Robespierre, Danton, or 
Saint Just. At the bottom of such events is always to be found 
the working of the soul of the masses, and never the power of 
potentates. 
BOOK II 
THE OPINIONS AND BELIEFS OF CROWDS 
CHAPTER I 
REMOTE FACTORS OF THE OPINIONS AND BELIEFS OF CROWDS 
Preparatory factors of the beliefs of crowds--The origin of the 
beliefs of crowds is the consequence of a preliminary process of 
elaboration-- Study of the different factors of these beliefs. 
1. RACE. The predominating influence it exercises--It 
represents the suggestions of ancestors.  2. TRADITIONS. 
They are the synthesis of the soul of the race--Social importance 
of traditions--How, after having been necessary they become 
harmful--Crowds are the most obstinate maintainers of traditional 
ideas.  3. TIME. It prepares in succession the establishment 
of beliefs and then their destruction. It is by the aid of this 
factor that order may proceed from chaos.  4. POLITICAL AND 
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS. Erroneous idea of their part--Their 
influence extremely weak--They are effects, not causes--Nations 
are incapable of choosing what appear to them the best 
institutions--Institutions are labels which shelter the most 
dissimilar things under the same title-- How institutions may 
come to be created--Certain institutions theoretically bad, such 
as centralisation obligatory for certain nations.  5. 
INSTITUTIONS AND EDUCATION. Falsity of prevalent ideas as to the 
influence of instruction on crowds-- Statistical 
indications--Demoralising effect of Latin system of 
education--Part instruction might play--Examples furnished by 
various peoples. 
Having studied the mental constitution of crowds and become 
acquainted with their modes of feeling, thinking, and reasoning, 
we shall now proceed to examine how their opinions and beliefs 
arise and become established. 
The factors which determine these opinions and beliefs are of two 
kinds: remote factors and immediate factors. 
The remote factors are those which render crowds capable of 
adopting certain convictions and absolutely refractory to the 
acceptance of others. These factors prepare the ground in which 
are suddenly seen to germinate certain new ideas whose force and 
consequences are a cause of astonishment, though they are only 
spontaneous in appearance. The outburst and putting in practice 
of certain ideas among crowds present at times a startling 
suddenness. This is only a superficial effect, behind which must 
be sought a preliminary and preparatory action of long duration. 
The immediate factors are those which, coming on the top of this 
long, preparatory working, in whose absence they would remain 
without effect, serve as the source of active persuasion on 
crowds; that is, they are the factors which cause the idea to 
take shape and set it loose with all its consequences. The 
resolutions by which collectivities are suddenly carried away 
arise out of these immediate factors; it is due to them that a 
riot breaks out or a strike is decided upon, and to them that 
enormous majorities invest one man with power to overthrow a 
government. 
The successive action of these two kinds of factors is to be 
traced in all great historical events. The French Revolution--to 
cite but one of the most striking of such events--had among its 
remote factors the writings of the philosophers, the exactions of 
the nobility, and the progress of scientific thought. The mind 
of the masses, thus prepared, was then easily roused by such 
immediate factors as the speeches of orators, and the resistance 
of the court party to insignificant reforms. 
Among the remote factors there are some of a general nature, 
which are found to underlie all the beliefs and opinions of 
crowds. They are race, traditions, time, institutions, and 
education. 
We now proceed to study the influence of these different factors. 
1. RACE 
This factor, race, must be placed in the first rank, for in 
itself it far surpasses in importance all the others. We have 
sufficiently studied it in another work; it is therefore needless 
to deal with it again. We showed, in a previous volume, what an 
historical race is, and how, its character once formed, it 
possesses, as the result of the laws of heredity such power that 
its beliefs, institutions, and arts--in a word, all the elements 
of its civilisation--are merely the outward expression of its 
genius. We showed that the power of the race is such that no 
element can pass from one people to another without undergoing 
the most profound transformations.[7] 
[7] The novelty of this proposition being still considerable and 
history being quite unintelligible without it, I devoted four 
chapters to its demonstration in my last book (""The Psychological 
Laws of the Evolution of Peoples""). From it the reader will see 
that, in spite of fallacious appearances, neither language, 
religion, arts, or, in a word, any element of civilisation, can 
pass, intact, from one people to another. 
Environment, circumstances, and events represent the social 
suggestions of the moment. They may have a considerable 
influence, but this influence is always momentary if it be 
contrary to the suggestions of the race; that is, to those which 
are inherited by a nation from the entire series of its 
ancestors. 
We shall have occasion in several of the chapters of this work to 
touch again upon racial influence, and to show that this 
influence is so great that it dominates the characteristics 
peculiar to the genius of crowds. It follows from this fact that 
the crowds of different countries offer very considerable 
differences of beliefs and conduct and are not to be influenced 
in the same manner. 
2. TRADITIONS 
Traditions represent the ideas, the needs, and the sentiments of 
the past. They are the synthesis of the race, and weigh upon us 
with immense force. 
The biological sciences have been transformed since embryology 
has shown the immense influence of the past on the evolution of 
living beings; and the historical sciences will not undergo a 
less change when this conception has become more widespread. As 
yet it is not sufficiently general, and many statesmen are still 
no further advanced than the theorists of the last century, who 
believed that a society could break off with its past and be 
entirely recast on lines suggested solely by the light of reason. 
A people is an organism created by the past, and, like every 
other organism, it can only be modified by slow hereditary 
accumulations. 
It is tradition that guides men, and more especially so when they 
are in a crowd. The changes they can effect in their traditions 
with any ease, merely bear, as I have often repeated, upon names 
and outward forms. 
This circumstance is not to be regretted. Neither a national 
genius nor civilisation would be possible without traditions. In 
consequence man's two great concerns since he has existed have 
been to create a network of traditions which he afterwards 
endeavours to destroy when their beneficial effects have worn 
themselves out. Civilisation is impossible without traditions, 
and progress impossible without the destruction of those 
traditions. The difficulty, and it is an immense difficulty, is 
to find a proper equilibrium between stability and variability. 
Should a people allow its customs to become too firmly rooted, it 
can no longer change, and becomes, like China, incapable of 
improvement. Violent revolutions are in this case of no avail; 
for what happens is that either the broken fragments of the chain 
are pieced together again and the past resumes its empire without 
change, or the fragments remain apart and decadence soon succeeds 
anarchy. 
The ideal for a people is in consequence to preserve the 
institutions of the past, merely changing them insensibly and 
little by little. This ideal is difficult to realise. The 
Romans in ancient and the English in modern times are almost 
alone in having realised it. 
It is precisely crowds that cling the most tenaciously to 
traditional ideas and oppose their being changed with the most 
obstinacy. This is notably the case with the category of crowds 
constituting castes. I have already insisted upon the 
conservative spirit of crowds, and shown that the most violent 
rebellions merely end in a changing of words and terms. At the 
end of the last century, in the presence of destroyed churches, 
of priests expelled the country or guillotined, it might have 
been thought that the old religious ideas had lost all their 
strength, and yet a few years had barely lapsed before the 
abolished system of public worship had to be re-established in 
deference to universal demands.[8] 
[8] The report of the ex-Conventionist, Fourcroy, quoted by 
Taine, is very clear on this point. 
""What is everywhere seen with respect to the keeping of Sunday 
and attendance at the churches proves that the majority of 
Frenchmen desire to return to their old usages and that it is no 
longer opportune to resist this natural tendency. . . . The 
great majority of men stand in need of religion, public worship, 
and priests. IT IS AN ERROR OF SOME MODERN PHILOSOPHERS, BY 
WHICH I MYSELF HAVE BEEN LED AWAY, to believe in the possibility 
of instruction being so general as to destroy religious 
prejudices, which for a great number of unfortunate persons are a 
source of consolation. . . . The mass of the people, then, must 
be allowed its priests, its altars, and its public worship."" 
Blotted out for a moment, the old traditions had resumed their 
sway. 
No example could better display the power of tradition on the 
mind of crowds. The most redoubtable idols do not dwell in 
temples, nor the most despotic tyrants in palaces; both the one 
and the other can be broken in an instant. But the invisible 
masters that reign in our innermost selves are safe from every 
effort at revolt, and only yield to the slow wearing away of 
centuries. 
3. TIME 
In social as in biological problems time is one of the most 
energetic factors. It is the sole real creator and the sole 
great destroyer. It is time that has made mountains with grains 
of sand and raised the obscure cell of geological eras to human 
dignity. The action of centuries is sufficient to transform any 
given phenomenon. It has been justly observed that an ant with 
enough time at its disposal could level Mount Blanc. A being 
possessed of the magical force of varying time at his will would 
have the power attributed by believers to God. 
In this place, however, we have only to concern ourselves with 
the influence of time on the genesis of the opinions of crowds. 
Its action from this point of view is still immense. Dependent 
upon it are the great forces such as race, which cannot form 
themselves without it. It causes the birth, the growth, and the 
death of all beliefs. It is by the aid of time that they acquire 
their strength and also by its aid that they lose it. 
It is time in particular that prepares the opinions and beliefs 
of crowds, or at least the soil on which they will germinate. 
This is why certain ideas are realisable at one epoch and not at 
another. It is time that accumulates that immense detritus of 
beliefs and thoughts on which the ideas of a given period spring 
up. They do not grow at hazard and by chance; the roots of each 
of them strike down into a long past. When they blossom it is 
time that has prepared their blooming; and to arrive at a notion 
of their genesis it is always back in the past that it is 
necessary to search. They are the daughters of the past and the 
mothers of the future, but throughout the slaves of time. 
Time, in consequence, is our veritable master, and it suffices to 
leave it free to act to see all things transformed. At the 
present day we are very uneasy with regard to the threatening 
aspirations of the masses and the destructions and upheavals 
foreboded thereby. Time, without other aid, will see to the 
restoration of equilibrium. ""No form of government,"" M. Lavisse 
very properly writes, ""was founded in a day. Political and 
social organisations are works that demand centuries. The feudal 
system existed for centuries in a shapeless, chaotic state before 
it found its laws; absolute monarchy also existed for centuries 
before arriving at regular methods of government, and these 
periods of expectancy were extremely troubled."" 
4. POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
The idea that institutions can remedy the defects of societies, 
that national progress is the consequence of the improvement of 
institutions and governments, and that social changes can be 
effected by decrees-- this idea, I say, is still generally 
accepted. It was the starting-point of the French Revolution, 
and the social theories of the present day are based upon it. 
The most continuous experience has been unsuccessful in shaking 
this grave delusion. Philosophers and historians have 
endeavoured in vain to prove its absurdity, but yet they have had 
no difficulty in demonstrating that institutions are the outcome 
of ideas, sentiments, and customs, and that ideas, sentiments, 
and customs are not to be recast by recasting legislative codes. 
A nation does not choose its institutions at will any more than 
it chooses the colour of its hair or its eyes. Institutions and 
governments are the product of the race. They are not the 
creators of an epoch, but are created by it. Peoples are not 
governed in accordance with their caprices of the moment, but as 
their character determines that they shall be governed. 
Centuries are required to form a political system and centuries 
needed to change it. Institutions have no intrinsic virtue: in 
themselves they are neither good nor bad. Those which are good 
at a given moment for a given people may be harmful in the 
extreme for another nation. 
Moreover, it is in no way in the power of a people to really 
change its institutions. Undoubtedly, at the cost of violent 
revolutions, it can change their name, but in their essence they 
remain unmodified. The names are mere futile labels with which 
an historian who goes to the bottom of things need scarcely 
concern himself. It is in this way, for instance, that 
England,[9] the most democratic country in the world, lives, 
nevertheless, under a monarchical regime, whereas the countries 
in which the most oppressive despotism is rampant are the 
Spanish-American Republics, in spite of their republican 
constitutions. The destinies of peoples are determined by their 
character and not by their government. I have endeavoured to 
establish this view in my previous volume by setting forth 
categorical examples. 
[9] The most advanced republicans, even of the United States, 
recognise this fact. The American magazine, The Forum, recently 
gave categorical expression to the opinion in terms which I 
reproduce here from the Review of Reviews for December, 1894:-- 
""It should never be forgotten, even by the most ardent enemies of 
an aristocracy, that England is to-day the most democratic 
country of the universe, the country in which the rights of the 
individual are most respected, and in which the individual 
possesses the most liberty."" 
To lose time in the manufacture of cut-and-dried constitutions 
is, in consequence, a puerile task, the useless labour of an 
ignorant rhetorician. Necessity and time undertake the charge of 
elaborating constitutions when we are wise enough to allow these 
two factors to act. This is the plan the Anglo-Saxons have 
adopted, as their great historian, Macaulay, teaches us in a 
passage that the politicians of all Latin countries ought to 
learn by heart. After having shown all the good that can be 
accomplished by laws which appear from the point of view of pure 
reason a chaos of absurdities and contradictions, he compares the 
scores of constitutions that have been engulfed in the 
convulsions of the Latin peoples with that of England, and points 
out that the latter has only been very slowly changed part by 
part, under the influence of immediate necessities and never of 
speculative reasoning. 
""To think nothing of symmetry and much of convenience; never to 
remove an anomaly merely because it is an anomaly; never to 
innovate except when some grievance is felt; never to innovate 
except so far as to get rid of the grievance; never to lay down 
any proposition of wider extent than the particular case for 
which it is necessary to provide; these are the rules which have, 
from the age of John to the age of Victoria, generally guided the 
deliberations of our two hundred and fifty Parliaments."" 
It would be necessary to take one by one the laws and 
institutions of each people to show to what extent they are the 
expression of the needs of each race and are incapable, for that 
reason, of being violently transformed. It is possible, for, 
instance, to indulge in philosophical dissertations on the 
advantages and disadvantages of centralisation; but when we see a 
people composed of very different races devote a thousand years 
of efforts to attaining to this centralisation; when we observe 
that a great revolution, having for object the destruction of all 
the institutions of the past, has been forced to respect this 
centralisation, and has even strengthened it; under these 
circumstances we should admit that it is the outcome of imperious 
needs, that it is a condition of the existence of the nation in 
question, and we should pity the poor mental range of politicians 
who talk of destroying it. Could they by chance succeed in this 
attempt, their success would at once be the signal for a 
frightful civil war,[10] which, moreover, would immediately bring 
back a new system of centralisation much more oppressive than the 
old. 
[10] If a comparison be made between the profound religious and 
political dissensions which separate the various parties in 
France, and are more especially the result of social questions, 
and the separatist tendencies which were manifested at the time 
of the Revolution, and began to again display themselves towards 
the close of the Franco-German war, it will be seen that the 
different races represented in France are still far from being 
completely blended. The vigorous centralisation of the 
Revolution and the creation of artificial departments destined to 
bring about the fusion of the ancient provinces was certainly its 
most useful work. Were it possible to bring about the 
decentralisation which is to-day preoccupying minds lacking in 
foresight, the achievement would promptly have for consequence 
the most sanguinary disorders. To overlook this fact is to leave 
out of account the entire history of France. 
The conclusion to be drawn from what precedes is, that it is not 
in institutions that the means is to be sought of profoundly 
influencing the genius of the masses. When we see certain 
countries, such as the United States, reach a high degree of 
prosperity under democratic institutions, while others, such as 
the Spanish-American Republics, are found existing in a pitiable 
state of anarchy under absolutely similar institutions, we should 
admit that these institutions are as foreign to the greatness of 
the one as to the decadence of the others. Peoples are governed 
by their character, and all institutions which are not intimately 
modelled on that character merely represent a borrowed garment, a 
transitory disguise. No doubt sanguinary wars and violent 
revolutions have been undertaken, and will continue to be 
undertaken, to impose institutions to which is attributed, as to 
the relics of saints, the supernatural power of creating welfare. 
It may be said, then, in one sense, that institutions react on 
the mind of the crowd inasmuch as they engender such upheavals. 
But in reality it is not the institutions that react in this 
manner, since we know that, whether triumphant or vanquished, 
they possess in themselves no virtue. It is illusions and words 
that have influenced the mind of the crowd, and especially 
words-- words which are as powerful as they are chimerical, and 
whose astonishing sway we shall shortly demonstrate. 
5. INSTRUCTION AND EDUCATION 
Foremost among the dominant ideas of the present epoch is to be 
found the notion that instruction is capable of considerably 
changing men, and has for its unfailing consequence to improve 
them and even to make them equal. By the mere fact of its being 
constantly repeated, this assertion has ended by becoming one of 
the most steadfast democratic dogmas. It would be as difficult 
now to attack it as it would have been formerly to have attacked 
the dogmas of the Church. 
On this point, however, as on many others, democratic ideas are 
in profound disagreement with the results of psychology and 
experience. Many eminent philosophers, among them Herbert 
Spencer, have had no difficulty in showing that instruction 
neither renders a man more moral nor happier, that it changes 
neither his instincts nor his hereditary passions, and that at 
times--for this to happen it need only be badly directed--it is 
much more pernicious than useful. Statisticians have brought 
confirmation of these views by telling us that criminality 
increases with the generalisation of instruction, or at any rate 
of a certain kind of instruction, and that the worst enemies of 
society, the anarchists, are recruited among the prize-winners of 
schools; while in a recent work a distinguished magistrate, M. 
Adolphe Guillot, made the observation that at present 3,000 
educated criminals are met with for every 1,000 illiterate 
delinquents, and that in fifty years the criminal percentage of 
the population has passed from 227 to 552 for every 100,000 
inhabitants, an increase of 133 per cent. He has also noted in 
common with his colleagues that criminality is particularly on 
the increase among young persons, for whom, as is known, 
gratuitous and obligatory schooling has--in France--replaced 
apprenticeship. 
It is not assuredly--and nobody has ever maintained this 
proposition-- that well-directed instruction may not give very 
useful practical results, if not in the sense of raising the 
standard of morality, at least in that of developing professional 
capacity. Unfortunately the Latin peoples, especially in the 
last twenty-five years, have based their systems of instruction 
on very erroneous principles, and in spite of the observations of 
the most eminent minds, such as Breal, Fustel de Coulanges, 
Taine, and many others, they persist in their lamentable 
mistakes. I have myself shown, in a work published some time 
ago, that the French system of education transforms the majority 
of those who have undergone it into enemies of society, and 
recruits numerous disciples for the worst forms of socialism. 
The primary danger of this system of education--very properly 
qualified as Latin--consists in the fact that it is based on the 
fundamental psychological error that the intelligence is 
developed by the learning by heart of text-books. Adopting this 
view, the endeavour has been made to enforce a knowledge of as 
many hand-books as possible. From the primary school till he 
leaves the university a young man does nothing but acquire books 
by heart without his judgment or personal initiative being ever 
called into play. Education consists for him in reciting by 
heart and obeying. 
""Learning lessons, knowing by heart a grammar or a compendium, 
repeating well and imitating well--that,"" writes a former 
Minister of Public Instruction, M. Jules Simon, ""is a ludicrous 
form of education whose every effort is an act of faith tacitly 
admitting the infallibility of the master, and whose only results 
are a belittling of ourselves and a rendering of us impotent."" 
Were this education merely useless, one might confine one's self 
to expressing compassion for the unhappy children who, instead of 
making needful studies at the primary school, are instructed in 
the genealogy of the sons of Clotaire, the conflicts between 
Neustria and Austrasia, or zoological classifications. But the 
system presents a far more serious danger. It gives those who 
have been submitted to it a violent dislike to the state of life 
in which they were born, and an intense desire to escape from it. 
The working man no longer wishes to remain a working man, or the 
peasant to continue a peasant, while the most humble members of 
the middle classes admit of no possible career for their sons 
except that of State-paid functionaries. Instead of preparing 
men for life French schools solely prepare them to occupy public 
functions, in which success can be attained without any necessity 
for self-direction or the exhibition of the least glimmer of 
personal initiative. At the bottom of the social ladder the 
system creates an army of proletarians discontented with their 
lot and always ready to revolt, while at the summit it brings 
into being a frivolous bourgeoisie, at once sceptical and 
credulous, having a superstitious confidence in the State, whom 
it regards as a sort of Providence, but without forgetting to 
display towards it a ceaseless hostility, always laying its own 
faults to the door of the Government, and incapable of the least 
enterprise without the intervention of the authorities. 
The State, which manufactures by dint of textbooks all these 
persons possessing diplomas, can only utilise a small number of 
them, and is forced to leave the others without employment. It 
is obliged in consequence to resign itself to feeding the first 
mentioned and to having the others as its enemies. From the top 
to the bottom of the social pyramid, from the humblest clerk to 
the professor and the prefect, the immense mass of persons 
boasting diplomas besiege the professions. While a business man 
has the greatest difficulty in finding an agent to represent him 
in the colonies, thousands of candidates solicit the most modest 
official posts. There are 20,000 schoolmasters and mistresses 
without employment in the department of the Seine alone, all of 
them persons who, disdaining the fields or the workshops, look to 
the State for their livelihood. The number of the chosen being 
restricted, that of the discontented is perforce immense. The 
latter are ready for any revolution, whoever be its chiefs and 
whatever the goal they aim at. The acquisition of knowledge for 
which no use can be found is a sure method of driving a man to 
revolt.[11] 
[11] This phenomenon, moreover, is not peculiar to the Latin 
peoples. It is also to be observed in China, which is also a 
country in the hands of a solid hierarchy of mandarins or 
functionaries, and where a function is obtained, as in France, by 
competitive examination, in which the only test is the 
imperturbable recitation of bulky manuals. The army of educated 
persons without employment is considered in China at the present 
day as a veritable national calamity. It is the same in India 
where, since the English have opened schools, not for educating 
purposes, as is the case in England itself, but simply to furnish 
the indigenous inhabitants with instruction, there has been 
formed a special class of educated persons, the Baboos, who, when 
they do not obtain employment, become the irreconcilable enemies 
of the English rule. In the case of all the Baboos, whether 
provided with employment or not, the first effect of their 
instruction has been to lower their standard of morality. This 
is a fact on which I have insisted at length in my book, ""The 
Civilisations of India""--a fact, too, which has been observed by 
all authors who have visited the great peninsula. 
It is evidently too late to retrace our steps. Experience alone, 
that supreme educator of peoples, will be at pains to show us our 
mistake. It alone will be powerful enough to prove the necessity 
of replacing our odious text-books and our pitiable examinations 
by industrial instruction capable of inducing our young men to 
return to the fields, to the workshop, and to the colonial 
enterprise which they avoid to-day at all costs. 
The professional instruction which all enlightened minds are now 
demanding was the instruction received in the past by our 
forefathers. It is still in vigour at the present day among the 
nations who rule the world by their force of will, their 
initiative, and their spirit of enterprise. In a series of 
remarkable pages, whose principal passages I reproduce further 
on, a great thinker, M. Taine, has clearly shown that our former 
system of education was approximately that in vogue to-day in 
England and America, and in a remarkable parallel between the 
Latin and Anglo-Saxon systems he has plainly pointed out the 
consequences of the two methods. 
One might consent, perhaps, at a pinch, to continue to accept all 
the disadvantages of our classical education, although it 
produced nothing but discontented men, and men unfitted for their 
station in life, did the superficial acquisition of so much 
knowledge, the faultless repeating by heart of so many 
text-books, raise the level of intelligence. But does it really 
raise this level? Alas, no! The conditions of success in life 
are the possession of judgment, experience, initiative, and 
character--qualities which are not bestowed by books. Books are 
dictionaries, which it is useful to consult, but of which it is 
perfectly useless to have lengthy portions in one's head. 
How is it possible for professional instruction to develop the 
intelligence in a measure quite beyond the reach of classical 
instruction? This has been well shown by M. Taine. 
""Ideas, he says, are only formed in their natural and normal 
surroundings; the promotion of the growth is effected by the 
innumerable impressions appealing to the senses which a young man 
receives daily in the workshop, the mine, the law court, the 
study, the builder's yard, the hospital; at the sight of tools, 
materials, and operations; in the presence of customers, workers, 
and labour, of work well or ill done, costly or lucrative. In 
such a way are obtained those trifling perceptions of detail of 
the eyes, the ear, the hands, and even the sense of smell, which, 
picked up involuntarily, and silently elaborated, take shape 
within the learner, and suggest to him sooner or, later this or 
that new combination, simplification, economy, improvement, or 
invention. The young Frenchman is deprived, and precisely at the 
age when they are most fruitful, of all these precious contacts, 
of all these indispensable elements of assimilation. For seven 
or eight years on end he is shut up in a school, and is cut off 
from that direct personal experience which would give him a keen 
and exact notion of men and things and of the various ways of 
handling them."" 
"" . . . At least nine out of ten have wasted their time and pains 
during several years of their life--telling, important, even 
decisive years. Among such are to be counted, first of all, the 
half or two-thirds of those who present themselves for 
examination--I refer to those who are rejected; and then among 
those who are successful, who obtain a degree, a certificate, a 
diploma, there is still a half or two-thirds--I refer to the 
overworked. Too much has been demanded of them by exacting that 
on a given day, on a chair or before a board, they should, for 
two hours in succession, and with respect to a group of sciences, 
be living repertories of all human knowledge. In point of fact 
they were that, or nearly so, for two hours on that particular 
day, but a month later they are so no longer. They could not go 
through the examination again. Their too numerous and too 
burdensome acquisitions slip incessantly from their mind, and are 
not replaced. Their mental vigour has declined, their fertile 
capacity for growth has dried up, the fully-developed man 
appears, and he is often a used-up man. Settled down, married, 
resigned to turning in a circle, and indefinitely in the same 
circle, he shuts himself up in his confined function, which he 
fulfils adequately, but nothing more. Such is the average yield: 
assuredly the receipts do not balance the expenditure. In 
England or America, where, as in France previous to 1789, the 
contrary proceeding is adopted, the outcome obtained is equal or 
superior."" 
The illustrious psychologist subsequently shows us the difference 
between our system and that of the Anglo-Saxons. The latter do 
not possess our innumerable special schools. With them 
instruction is not based on book-learning, but on object lessons. 
The engineer, for example, is trained in a workshop, and never at 
a school; a method which allows of each individual reaching the 
level his intelligence permits of. He becomes a workman or a 
foreman if he can get no further, an engineer if his aptitudes 
take him as far. This manner of proceeding is much more 
democratic and of much greater benefit to society than that of 
making the whole career of an individual depend on an 
examination, lasting a few hours, and undergone at the age of 
nineteen or twenty. 
""In the hospital, the mine, the factory, in the architect's or 
the lawyer's office, the student, who makes a start while very 
young, goes through his apprenticeship, stage by stage, much as 
does with us a law clerk in his office, or an artist in his 
studio. Previously, and before making a practical beginning, he 
has had an opportunity of following some general and summary 
course of instruction, so as to have a framework ready prepared 
in which to store the observations he is shortly to make. 
Furthermore he is able, as a rule, to avail himself of sundry 
technical courses which he can follow in his leisure hours, so as 
to co-ordinate step by step the daily experience he is gathering. 
Under such a system the practical capabilities increase and 
develop of themselves in exact proportion to the faculties of the 
student, and in the direction requisite for his future task and 
the special work for which from now onwards he desires to fit 
himself. By this means in England or the United States a young 
man is quickly in a position to develop his capacity to the 
utmost. At twenty-five years of age, and much sooner if the 
material and the parts are there, he is not merely a useful 
performer, he is capable also of spontaneous enterprise; he is 
not only a part of a machine, but also a motor. In France, where 
the contrary system prevails--in France, which with each 
succeeding generation is falling more and more into line with 
China--the sum total of the wasted forces is enormous."" 
The great philosopher arrives at the following conclusion with 
respect to the growing incongruity between our Latin system of 
education and the requirements of practical life:-- 
""In the three stages of instruction, those of childhood, 
adolescence and youth, the theoretical and pedagogic preparation 
by books on the school benches has lengthened out and become 
overcharged in view of the examination, the degree, the diploma, 
and the certificate, and solely in this view, and by the worst 
methods, by the application of an unnatural and anti-social 
regime, by the excessive postponement of the practical 
apprenticeship, by our boarding-school system, by artificial 
training and mechanical cramming, by overwork, without thought 
for the time that is to follow, for the adult age and the 
functions of the man, without regard for the real world on which 
the young man will shortly be thrown, for the society in which we 
move and to which he must be adapted or be taught to resign 
himself in advance, for the struggle in which humanity is 
engaged, and in which to defend himself and to keep his footing 
he ought previously to have been equipped, armed, trained, and 
hardened. This indispensable equipment, this acquisition of more 
importance than any other, this sturdy common sense and nerve and 
will-power our schools do not procure the young Frenchman; on the 
contrary, far from qualifying him for his approaching and 
definite state, they disqualify him. In consequence, his entry 
into the world and his first steps in the field of action are 
most often merely a succession of painful falls, whose effect is 
that he long remains wounded and bruised, and sometimes disabled 
for life. The test is severe and dangerous. In the course of it 
the mental and moral equilibrium is affected, and runs the risk 
of not being re-established. Too sudden and complete disillusion 
has supervened. The deceptions have been too great, the 
disappointments too keen.""[12] 
[12] Taine, ""Le Regime moderne,"" vol. ii., 1894. These pages are 
almost the last that Taine wrote. They resume admirably the 
results of the great philosopher's long experience. 
Unfortunately they are in my opinion totally incomprehensible for 
such of our university professors who have not lived abroad. 
Education is the only means at our disposal of influencing to 
some extent the mind of a nation, and it is profoundly saddening 
to have to think that there is scarcely any one in France who can 
arrive at understanding that our present system of teaching is a 
grave cause of rapid decadence, which instead of elevating our 
youth, lowers and perverts it. 
A useful comparison may be made between Taine's pages and the 
observations on American education recently made by M. Paul 
Bourget in his excellent book, ""Outre-Mer.""  He, too, after 
having noted that our education merely produces narrow-minded 
bourgeois, lacking in initiative and will-power, or 
anarchists--""those two equally harmful types of the civilised 
man, who degenerates into impotent platitude or insane 
destructiveness""--he too, I say, draws a comparison that cannot 
be the object of too much reflection between our French lycees 
(public schools), those factories of degeneration, and the 
American schools, which prepare a man admirably for life. The 
gulf existing between truly democratic nations and those who have 
democracy in their speeches, but in no wise in their thoughts, is 
clearly brought out in this comparison. 
Have we digressed in what precedes from the psychology of crowds? 
Assuredly not. If we desire to understand the ideas and beliefs 
that are germinating to-day in the masses, and will spring up 
to-morrow, it is necessary to know how the ground has been 
prepared. The instruction given the youth of a country allows of 
a knowledge of what that country will one day be. The education 
accorded the present generation justifies the most gloomy 
previsions. It is in part by instruction and education that the 
mind of the masses is improved or deteriorated. It was necessary 
in consequence to show how this mind has been fashioned by the 
system in vogue, and how the mass of the indifferent and the 
neutral has become progressively an army of the discontented 
ready to obey all the suggestions of utopians and rhetoricians. 
It is in the schoolroom that socialists and anarchists are found 
nowadays, and that the way is being paved for the approaching 
period of decadence for the Latin peoples. 
CHAPTER II 
THE IMMEDIATE FACTORS OF THE OPINIONS OF CROWDS 
1. IMAGES, WORDS AND FORMULAE. The magical power of words 
and formulae--The power of words bound up with the images they 
evoke, and independent of their real sense--These images vary 
from age to age, and from race to race--The wear and tear of 
words--Examples of the considerable variations of sense of 
much-used words--The political utility of baptizing old things 
with new names when the words by which they were designated 
produced an unfavourable impression on the masses-- variations of 
the sense of words in consequence of race differences--The 
different meanings of the word ""democracy"" in Europe and America. 
2. ILLUSIONS. Their importance--They are to be found at the 
root of all civilisations--The social necessity of 
illusions--Crowds always prefer them to truths.  3. 
EXPERIENCE. Experience alone can fix in the mind of crowds truths 
become necessary and destroy illusions grown 
dangerous--Experience is only effective on the condition that it 
be frequently repeated--The cost of the experiences requisite to 
persuade crowds.  4. REASON. The nullity of its influence on 
crowds--Crowds only to be influenced by their unconscious 
sentiments-- The role of logic in history--The secret causes of 
improbable events. 
We have just investigated the remote and preparatory factors 
which give the mind of crowds a special receptivity, and make 
possible therein the growth of certain sentiments and certain 
ideas. It now remains for us to study the factors capable of 
acting in a direct manner. We shall see in a forthcoming chapter 
how these factors should be put in force in order that they may 
produce their full effect. 
In the first part of this work we studied the sentiments, ideas, 
and methods of reasoning of collective bodies, and from the 
knowledge thus acquired it would evidently be possible to deduce 
in a general way the means of making an impression on their mind. 
We already know what strikes the imagination of crowds, and are 
acquainted with the power and contagiousness of suggestions, of 
those especially that are presented under the form of images. 
However, as suggestions may proceed from very different sources, 
the factors capable of acting on the minds of crowds may differ 
considerably. It is necessary, then, to study them separately. 
This is not a useless study. Crowds are somewhat like the sphinx 
of ancient fable: it is necessary to arrive at a solution of the 
problems offered by their psychology or to resign ourselves to 
being devoured by them. 
1. IMAGES, WORDS, AND FORMULAS 
When studying the imagination of crowds we saw that it is 
particularly open to the impressions produced by images. These 
images do not always lie ready to hand, but it is possible to 
evoke them by the judicious employment of words and formulas. 
Handled with art, they possess in sober truth the mysterious 
power formerly attributed to them by the adepts of magic. They 
cause the birth in the minds of crowds of the most formidable 
tempests, which in turn they are capable of stilling. A pyramid 
far loftier than that of old Cheops could be raised merely with 
the bones of men who have been victims of the power of words and 
formulas. 
The power of words is bound up with the images they evoke, and is 
quite independent of their real significance. Words whose sense 
is the most ill-defined are sometimes those that possess the most 
influence. Such, for example, are the terms democracy, 
socialism, equality, liberty, &amp;c., whose meaning is so vague that 
bulky volumes do not suffice to precisely fix it. Yet it is 
certain that a truly magical power is attached to those short 
syllables, as if they contained the solution of all problems. 
They synthesise the most diverse unconscious aspirations and the 
hope of their realisation. 
Reason and arguments are incapable of combatting certain words 
and formulas. They are uttered with solemnity in the presence of 
crowds, and as soon as they have been pronounced an expression of 
respect is visible on every countenance, and all heads are bowed. 
By many they are considered as natural forces, as supernatural 
powers. They evoke grandiose and vague images in men's minds, 
but this very vagueness that wraps them in obscurity augments 
their mysterious power. They are the mysterious divinities 
hidden behind the tabernacle, which the devout only approach in 
fear and trembling. 
The images evoked by words being independent of their sense, they 
vary from age to age and from people to people, the formulas 
remaining identical. Certain transitory images are attached to 
certain words: the word is merely as it were the button of an 
electric bell that calls them up. 
All words and all formulas do not possess the power of evoking 
images, while there are some which have once had this power, but 
lose it in the course of use, and cease to waken any response in 
the mind. They then become vain sounds, whose principal utility 
is to relieve the person who employs them of the obligation of 
thinking. Armed with a small stock of formulas and commonplaces 
learnt while we are young, we possess all that is needed to 
traverse life without the tiring necessity of having to reflect 
on anything whatever. 
If any particular language be studied, it is seen that the words 
of which it is composed change rather slowly in the course of 
ages, while the images these words evoke or the meaning attached 
to them changes ceaselessly. This is the reason why, in another 
work, I have arrived at the conclusion that the absolute 
translation of a language, especially of a dead language, is 
totally impossible. What do we do in reality when we substitute 
a French for a Latin, Greek, or Sanscrit expression, or even when 
we endeavour to understand a book written in our own tongue two 
or three centuries back? We merely put the images and ideas with 
which modern life has endowed our intelligence in the place of 
absolutely distinct notions and images which ancient life had 
brought into being in the mind of races submitted to conditions 
of existence having no analogy with our own. When the men of the 
Revolution imagined they were copying the Greeks and Romans, what 
were they doing except giving to ancient words a sense the latter 
had never had? What resemblance can possibly exist between the 
institutions of the Greeks and those designated to-day by 
corresponding words? A republic at that epoch was an essentially 
aristocratic institution, formed of a reunion of petty despots 
ruling over a crowd of slaves kept in the most absolute 
subjection. These communal aristocracies, based on slavery, 
could not have existed for a moment without it. 
The word ""liberty,"" again, what signification could it have in 
any way resembling that we attribute to it to-day at a period 
when the possibility of the liberty of thought was not even 
suspected, and when there was no greater and more exceptional 
crime than that of discussing the gods, the laws and the customs 
of the city? What did such a word as ""fatherland"" signify to an 
Athenian or Spartan unless it were the cult of Athens or Sparta, 
and in no wise that of Greece, composed of rival cities always at 
war with each other? What meaning had the same word ""fatherland"" 
among the ancient Gauls, divided into rival tribes and races, and 
possessing different languages and religions, and who were easily 
vanquished by Caesar because he always found allies among them? 
It was Rome that made a country of Gaul by endowing it with 
political and religious unity. Without going back so far, 
scarcely two centuries ago, is it to be believed that this same 
notion of a fatherland was conceived to have the same meaning as 
at present by French princes like the great Conde, who allied 
themselves with the foreigner against their sovereign? And yet 
again, the same word had it not a sense very different from the 
modern for the French royalist emigrants, who thought they obeyed 
the laws of honour in fighting against France, and who from their 
point of view did indeed obey them, since the feudal law bound 
the vassal to the lord and not to the soil, so that where the 
sovereign was there was the true fatherland? 
Numerous are the words whose meaning has thus profoundly changed 
from age to age--words which we can only arrive at understanding 
in the sense in which they were formerly understood after a long 
effort. It has been said with truth that much study is necessary 
merely to arrive at conceiving what was signified to our great 
grandfathers by such words as the ""king"" and the ""royal family."" 
What, then, is likely to be the case with terms still more 
complex? 
Words, then, have only mobile and transitory significations which 
change from age to age and people to people; and when we desire 
to exert an influence by their means on the crowd what it is 
requisite to know is the meaning given them by the crowd at a 
given moment, and not the meaning which they formerly had or may 
yet have for individuals of a different mental constitution. 
Thus, when crowds have come, as the result of political upheavals 
or changes of belief, to acquire a profound antipathy for the 
images evoked by certain words, the first duty of the true 
statesman is to change the words without, of course, laying hands 
on the things themselves, the latter being too intimately bound 
up with the inherited constitution to be transformed. The 
judicious Tocqueville long ago made the remark that the work of 
the consulate and the empire consisted more particularly in the 
clothing with new words of the greater part of the institutions 
of the past--that is to say, in replacing words evoking 
disagreeable images in the imagination of the crowd by other 
words of which the novelty prevented such evocations. The 
""taille"" or tallage has become the land tax; the ""gabelle,"" the 
tax on salt; the ""aids,"" the indirect contributions and the 
consolidated duties; the tax on trade companies and guilds, the 
license, &amp;c. 
One of the most essential functions of statesmen consists, then, 
in baptizing with popular or, at any rate, indifferent words 
things the crowd cannot endure under their old names. The power 
of words is so great that it suffices to designate in well-chosen 
terms the most odious things to make them acceptable to crowds. 
Taine justly observes that it was by invoking liberty and 
fraternity--words very popular at the time-- that the Jacobins 
were able ""to install a despotism worthy of Dahomey, a tribunal 
similar to that of the Inquisition, and to accomplish human 
hecatombs akin to those of ancient Mexico.""  The art of those who 
govern, as is the case with the art of advocates, consists above 
all in the science of employing words. One of the greatest 
difficulties of this art is, that in one and the same society the 
same words most often have very different meanings for the 
different social classes, who employ in appearance the same 
words, but never speak the same language. 
In the preceding examples it is especially time that has been 
made to intervene as the principal factor in the changing of the 
meaning of words. If, however, we also make race intervene, we 
shall then see that, at the same period, among peoples equally 
civilised but of different race, the same words very often 
correspond to extremely dissimilar ideas. It is impossible to 
understand these differences without having travelled much, and 
for this reason I shall not insist upon them. I shall confine 
myself to observing that it is precisely the words most often 
employed by the masses which among different peoples possess the 
most different meanings. Such is the case, for instance, with 
the words ""democracy"" and ""socialism"" in such frequent use 
nowadays. 
In reality they correspond to quite contrary ideas and images in 
the Latin and Anglo-Saxon mind. For the Latin peoples the word 
""democracy"" signifies more especially the subordination of the 
will and the initiative of the individual to the will and the 
initiative of the community represented by the State. It is the 
State that is charged, to a greater and greater degree, with the 
direction of everything, the centralisation, the monopolisation, 
and the manufacture of everything. To the State it is that all 
parties without exception, radicals, socialists, or monarchists, 
constantly appeal. Among the Anglo-Saxons and notably in America 
this same word ""democracy"" signifies, on the contrary, the 
intense development of the will of the individual, and as 
complete a subordination as possible of the State, which, with 
the exception of the police, the army, and diplomatic relations, 
is not allowed the direction of anything, not even of public 
instruction. It is seen, then, that the same word which 
signifies for one people the subordination of the will and the 
initiative of the individual and the preponderance of the State, 
signifies for another the excessive development of the will and 
the initiative of the individual and the complete subordination 
of the State.[13] 
[13] In my book, ""The Psychological Laws of the Evolution of 
Peoples,"" I have insisted at length on the differences which 
distinguish the Latin democratic ideal from the Anglo-Saxon 
democratic ideal. Independently, and as the result of his 
travels, M. Paul Bourget has arrived, in his quite recent book, 
""Outre-Mer,"" at conclusions almost identical with mine. 
2. ILLUSIONS 
From the dawn of civilisation onwards crowds have always 
undergone the influence of illusions. It is to the creators of 
illusions that they have raised more temples, statues, and altars 
than to any other class of men. Whether it be the religious 
illusions of the past or the philosophic and social illusions of 
the present, these formidable sovereign powers are always found 
at the head of all the civilisations that have successively 
flourished on our planet. It is in their name that were built 
the temples of Chaldea and Egypt and the religious edifices of 
the Middle Ages, and that a vast upheaval shook the whole of 
Europe a century ago, and there is not one of our political, 
artistic, or social conceptions that is free from their powerful 
impress. Occasionally, at the cost of terrible disturbances, man 
overthrows them, but he seems condemned to always set them up 
again. Without them he would never have emerged from his 
primitive barbarian state, and without them again he would soon 
return to it. Doubtless they are futile shadows; but these 
children of our dreams have forced the nations to create whatever 
the arts may boast of splendour or civilisation of greatness. 
""If one destroyed in museums and libraries, if one hurled down on 
the flagstones before the churches all the works and all the 
monuments of art that religions have inspired, what would remain 
of the great dreams of humanity? To give to men that portion of 
hope and illusion without which they cannot live, such is the 
reason for the existence of gods, heroes, and poets. During 
fifty years science appeared to undertake this task. But science 
has been compromised in hearts hungering after the ideal, because 
it does not dare to be lavish enough of promises, because it 
cannot lie.""[14] 
[14] Daniel Lesueur. 
The philosophers of the last century devoted themselves with 
fervour to the destruction of the religious, political, and 
social illusions on which our forefathers had lived for a long 
tale of centuries. By destroying them they have dried up the 
springs of hope and resignation. Behind the immolated chimeras 
they came face to face with the blind and silent forces of 
nature, which are inexorable to weakness and ignore pity. 
Notwithstanding all its progress, philosophy has been unable as 
yet to offer the masses any ideal that can charm them; but, as 
they must have their illusions at all cost, they turn 
instinctively, as the insect seeks the light, to the rhetoricians 
who accord them what they want. Not truth, but error has always 
been the chief factor in the evolution of nations, and the reason 
why socialism is so powerful to-day is that it constitutes the 
last illusion that is still vital. In spite of all scientific 
demonstrations it continues on the increase. Its principal 
strength lies in the fact that it is championed by minds 
sufficiently ignorant of things as they are in reality to venture 
boldly to promise mankind happiness. The social illusion reigns 
to-day upon all the heaped-up ruins of the past, and to it 
belongs the future. The masses have never thirsted after truth. 
They turn aside from evidence that is not to their taste, 
preferring to deify error, if error seduce them. Whoever can 
supply them with illusions is easily their master; whoever 
attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim. 
3. EXPERIENCE 
Experience constitutes almost the only effective process by which 
a truth may be solidly established in the mind of the masses, and 
illusions grown too dangerous be destroyed. To this end, 
however, it is necessary that the experience should take place on 
a very large scale, and be very frequently repeated. The 
experiences undergone by one generation are useless, as a rule, 
for the generation that follows, which is the reason why 
historical facts, cited with a view to demonstration, serve no 
purpose. Their only utility is to prove to what an extent 
experiences need to be repeated from age to age to exert any 
influence, or to be successful in merely shaking an erroneous 
opinion when it is solidly implanted in the mind of the masses. 
Our century and that which preceded it will doubtless be alluded 
to by historians as an era of curious experiments, which in no 
other age have been tried in such number. 
The most gigantic of these experiments was the French Revolution. 
To find out that a society is not to be refashioned from top to 
bottom in accordance with the dictates of pure reason, it was 
necessary that several millions of men should be massacred and 
that Europe should be profoundly disturbed for a period of twenty 
years. To prove to us experimentally that dictators cost the 
nations who acclaim them dear, two ruinous experiences have been 
required in fifty years, and in spite of their clearness they do 
not seem to have been sufficiently convincing. The first, 
nevertheless, cost three millions of men and an invasion, the 
second involved a loss of territory, and carried in its wake the 
necessity for permanent armies. A third was almost attempted not 
long since, and will assuredly be attempted one day. To bring an 
entire nation to admit that the huge German army was not, as was 
currently alleged thirty years ago, a sort of harmless national 
guard,[15] the terrible war which cost us so dear had to take 
place. To bring about the recognition that Protection ruins the 
nations who adopt it, at least twenty years of disastrous 
experience will be needful. These examples might be indefinitely 
multiplied. 
[15] The opinion of the crowd was formed in this case by those 
rough-and-ready associations of dissimilar things, the mechanism 
of which I have previously explained. The French national guard 
of that period, being composed of peaceable shopkeepers, utterly 
lacking in discipline and quite incapable of being taken 
seriously, whatever bore a similar name, evoked the same 
conception and was considered in consequence as harmless. The 
error of the crowd was shared at the time by its leaders, as 
happens so often in connection with opinions dealing with 
generalisations. In a speech made in the Chamber on the 31st of 
December, 1867, and quoted in a book by M. E. Ollivier that has 
appeared recently, a statesman who often followed the opinion of 
the crowd but was never in advance of it--I allude to M. 
Thiers--declared that Prussia only possessed a national guard 
analogous to that of France, and in consequence without 
importance, in addition to a regular army about equal to the 
French regular army; assertions about as accurate as the 
predictions of the same statesman as to the insignificant future 
reserved for railways. 
4. REASON 
In enumerating the factors capable of making an impression on the 
minds of crowds all mention of reason might be dispensed with, 
were it not necessary to point out the negative value of its 
influence. 
We have already shown that crowds are not to be influenced by 
reasoning, and can only comprehend rough-and-ready associations 
of ideas. The orators who know how to make an impression upon 
them always appeal in consequence to their sentiments and never 
to their reason. The laws of logic have no action on crowds.[16] 
To bring home conviction to crowds it is necessary first of all 
to thoroughly comprehend the sentiments by which they are 
animated, to pretend to share these sentiments, then to endeavour 
to modify them by calling up, by means of rudimentary 
associations, certain eminently suggestive notions, to be 
capable, if need be, of going back to the point of view from 
which a start was made, and, above all, to divine from instant to 
instant the sentiments to which one's discourse is giving birth. 
This necessity of ceaselessly varying one's language in 
accordance with the effect produced at the moment of speaking 
deprives from the outset a prepared and studied harangue of all 
efficaciousness. In such a speech the orator follows his own 
line of thought, not that of his hearers, and from this fact 
alone his influence is annihilated. 
[16] My first observations with regard to the art of impressing 
crowds and touching the slight assistance to be derived in this 
connection from the rules of logic date back to the seige of 
Paris, to the day when I saw conducted to the Louvre, where the 
Government was then sitting, Marshal V----, whom a furious crowd 
asserted they had surprised in the act of taking the plans of the 
fortifications to sell them to the Prussians. A member of the 
Government (G. P----), a very celebrated orator, came out to 
harangue the crowd, which was demanding the immediate execution 
of the prisoner. I had expected that the speaker would point out 
the absurdity of the accusation by remarking that the accused 
Marshal was positively one of those who had constructed the 
fortifications, the plan of which, moreover, was on sale at every 
booksellers. To my immense stupefaction--I was very young 
then--the speech was on quite different lines. ""Justice shall be 
done,"" exclaimed the orator, advancing towards the prisoner, ""and 
pitiless justice. Let the Government of the National Defence 
conclude your inquiry. In the meantime we will keep the prisoner 
in custody.""  At once calmed by this apparent concession, the 
crowd broke up, and a quarter of an hour later the Marshal was 
able to return home. He would infallibly have been torn in 
pieces had the speaker treated the infuriated crowd to the 
logical arguments that my extreme youth induced me to consider as 
very convincing. 
Logical minds, accustomed to be convinced by a chain of somewhat 
close reasoning, cannot avoid having recourse to this mode of 
persuasion when addressing crowds, and the inability of their 
arguments always surprises them. ""The usual mathematical 
consequences based on the syllogism--that is, on associations of 
identities--are imperative . . ."" writes a logician. ""This 
imperativeness would enforce the assent even of an inorganic mass 
were it capable of following associations of identities.""  This 
is doubtless true, but a crowd is no more capable than an 
inorganic mass of following such associations, nor even of 
understanding them. If the attempt be made to convince by 
reasoning primitive minds--savages or children, for instance--the 
slight value possessed by this method of arguing will be 
understood. 
It is not even necessary to descend so low as primitive beings to 
obtain an insight into the utter powerlessness of reasoning when 
it has to fight against sentiment. Let us merely call to mind 
how tenacious, for centuries long, have been religious 
superstitions in contradiction with the simplest logic. For 
nearly two thousand years the most luminous geniuses have bowed 
before their laws, and modern times have to be reached for their 
veracity to be merely contested. The Middle Ages and the 
Renaissance possessed many enlightened men, but not a single man 
who attained by reasoning to an appreciation of the childish side 
of his superstitions, or who promulgated even a slight doubt as 
to the misdeeds of the devil or the necessity of burning 
sorcerers. 
Should it be regretted that crowds are never guided by reason? 
We would not venture to affirm it. Without a doubt human reason 
would not have availed to spur humanity along the path of 
civilisation with the ardour and hardihood its illusions have 
done. These illusions, the offspring of those unconscious forces 
by which we are led, were doubtless necessary. Every race 
carries in its mental constitution the laws of its destiny, and 
it is, perhaps, these laws that it obeys with a resistless 
impulse, even in the case of those of its impulses which 
apparently are the most unreasoned. It seems at times as if 
nations were submitted to secret forces analogous to those which 
compel the acorn to transform itself into an oak or a comet to 
follow its orbit. 
What little insight we can get into these forces must be sought 
for in the general course of the evolution of a people, and not 
in the isolated facts from which this evolution appears at times 
to proceed. Were these facts alone to be taken into 
consideration, history would seem to be the result of a series of 
improbable chances. It was improbable that a Galilean carpenter 
should become for two thousand years an all-powerful God in whose 
name the most important civilisations were founded; improbable, 
too, that a few bands of Arabs, emerging from their deserts, 
should conquer the greater part of the old Graco-Roman world, and 
establish an empire greater than that of Alexander; improbable, 
again, that in Europe, at an advanced period of its development, 
and when authority throughout it had been systematically 
hierarchised, an obscure lieutenant of artillery should have 
succeeded in reigning over a multitude of peoples and kings. 
Let us leave reason, then, to philosophers, and not insist too 
strongly on its intervention in the governing of men. It is not 
by reason, but most often in spite of it, that are created those 
sentiments that are the mainsprings of all 
civilisation--sentiments such as honour, self- sacrifice, 
religious faith, patriotism, and the love of glory.

the leaders--The part played by the will.  2. THE MEANS OF 
ACTION OF THE LEADERS. Affirmation, repetition, contagion--The 
respective part of these different factors--The way in which

different kinds--Acquired prestige and personal prestige--Various 
examples--The way in which prestige is destroyed. 
We are now acquainted with the mental constitution of crowds, and 
we also know what are the motives capable of making an impression 
on their mind. It remains to investigate how these motives may 
be set in action, and by whom they may usefully be turned to 
practical account. 
1. THE LEADERS OF CROWDS. 
As soon as a certain number of living beings are gathered 
together, whether they be animals or men, they place themselves 
instinctively under the authority of a chief. 
In the case of human crowds the chief is often nothing more than 
a ringleader or agitator, but as such he plays a considerable 
part. His will is the nucleus around which the opinions of the 
crowd are grouped and attain to identity. He constitutes the 
first element towards the organisation of heterogeneous crowds, 
and paves the way for their organisation in sects; in the 
meantime he directs them. A crowd is a servile flock that is 
incapable of ever doing without a master. 
The leader has most often started as one of the led. He has 
himself been hypnotised by the idea, whose apostle he has since 
become. It has taken possession of him to such a degree that 
everything outside it vanishes, and that every contrary opinion 
appears to him an error or a superstition. An example in point 
is Robespierre, hypnotised by the philosophical ideas of 
Rousseau, and employing the methods of the Inquisition to 
propagate them. 
The leaders we speak of are more frequently men of action than 
thinkers. They are not gifted with keen foresight, nor could 
they be, as this quality generally conduces to doubt and 
inactivity. They are especially recruited from the ranks of 
those morbidly nervous, excitable, half-deranged persons who are 
bordering on madness. However absurd may be the idea they uphold 
or the goal they pursue, their convictions are so strong that all 
reasoning is lost upon them. Contempt and persecution do not 
affect them, or only serve to excite them the more. They 
sacrifice their personal interest, their family--everything. The 
very instinct of self-preservation is entirely obliterated in 
them, and so much so that often the only recompense they solicit 
is that of martyrdom. The intensity of their faith gives great 
power of suggestion to their words. The multitude is always 
ready to listen to the strong-willed man, who knows how to impose 
himself upon it. Men gathered in a crowd lose all force of will, 
and turn instinctively to the person who possesses the quality 
they lack. 
Nations have never lacked leaders, but all of the latter have by 
no means been animated by those strong convictions proper to 
apostles. These leaders are often subtle rhetoricians, seeking 
only their own personal interest, and endeavouring to persuade by 
flattering base instincts. The influence they can assert in this 
manner may be very great, but it is always ephemeral. The men of 
ardent convictions who have stirred the soul of crowds, the Peter 
the Hermits, the Luthers, the Savonarolas, the men of the French 
Revolution, have only exercised their fascination after having 
been themselves fascinated first of all by a creed. They are 
then able to call up in the souls of their fellows that 
formidable force known as faith, which renders a man the absolute 
slave of his dream. 
The arousing of faith--whether religious, political, or social, 
whether faith in a work, in a person, or an idea--has always been 
the function of the great leaders of crowds, and it is on this 
account that their influence is always very great. Of all the 
forces at the disposal of humanity, faith has always been one of 
the most tremendous, and the gospel rightly attributes to it the 
power of moving mountains. To endow a man with faith is to 
multiply his strength tenfold. The great events of history have 
been brought about by obscure believers, who have had little 
beyond their faith in their favour. It is not by the aid of the 
learned or of philosophers, and still less of sceptics, that have 
been built up the great religions which have swayed the world, or 
the vast empires which have spread from one hemisphere to the 
other. 
In the cases just cited, however, we are dealing with great 
leaders, and they are so few in number that history can easily 
reckon them up. They form the summit of a continuous series, 
which extends from these powerful masters of men down to the 
workman who, in the smoky atmosphere of an inn, slowly fascinates 
his comrades by ceaselessly drumming into their ears a few set 
phrases, whose purport he scarcely comprehends, but the 
application of which, according to him, must surely bring about 
the realisation of all dreams and of every hope. 
In every social sphere, from the highest to the lowest, as soon 
as a man ceases to be isolated he speedily falls under the 
influence of a leader. The majority of men, especially among the 
masses, do not possess clear and reasoned ideas on any subject 
whatever outside their own speciality. The leader serves them as 
guide. It is just possible that he may be replaced, though very 
inefficiently, by the periodical publications which manufacture 
opinions for their readers and supply them with ready- made 
phrases which dispense them of the trouble of reasoning. 
The leaders of crowds wield a very despotic authority, and this 
despotism indeed is a condition of their obtaining a following. 
It has often been remarked how easily they extort obedience, 
although without any means of backing up their authority, from 
the most turbulent section of the working classes. They fix the 
hours of labour and the rate of wages, and they decree strikes, 
which are begun and ended at the hour they ordain. 
At the present day these leaders and agitators tend more and more 
to usurp the place of the public authorities in proportion as the 
latter allow themselves to be called in question and shorn of 
their strength. The tyranny of these new masters has for result 
that the crowds obey them much more docilely than they have 
obeyed any government. If in consequence of some accident or 
other the leaders should be removed from the scene the crowd 
returns to its original state of a collectivity without cohesion 
or force of resistance. During the last strike of the Parisian 
omnibus employes the arrest of the two leaders who were directing 
it was at once sufficient to bring it to an end. It is the need 
not of liberty but of servitude that is always predominant in the 
soul of crowds. They are so bent on obedience that they 
instinctively submit to whoever declares himself their master. 
These ringleaders and agitators may be divided into two clearly 
defined classes. The one includes the men who are energetic and 
possess, but only intermittently, much strength of will, the 
other the men, far rarer than the preceding, whose strength of 
will is enduring. The first mentioned are violent, brave, and 
audacious. They are more especially useful to direct a violent 
enterprise suddenly decided on, to carry the masses with them in 
spite of danger, and to transform into heroes the men who but 
yesterday were recruits. Men of this kind were Ney and Murat 
under the First Empire, and such a man in our own time was 
Garibaldi, a talentless but energetic adventurer who succeeded 
with a handful of men in laying hands on the ancient kingdom of 
Naples, defended though it was by a disciplined army. 
Still, though the energy of leaders of this class is a force to 
be reckoned with, it is transitory, and scarcely outlasts the 
exciting cause that has brought it into play. When they have 
returned to their ordinary course of life the heroes animated by 
energy of this description often evince, as was the case with 
those I have just cited, the most astonishing weakness of 
character. They seem incapable of reflection and of conducting 
themselves under the simplest circumstances, although they had 
been able to lead others. These men are leaders who cannot 
exercise their function except on the condition that they be led 
themselves and continually stimulated, that they have always as 
their beacon a man or an idea, that they follow a line of conduct 
clearly traced. The second category of leaders, that of men of 
enduring strength of will, have, in spite of a less brilliant 
aspect, a much more considerable influence. In this category are 
to be found the true founders of religions and great 
undertakings: St. Paul, Mahomet, Christopher Columbus, and de 
Lesseps, for example. Whether they be intelligent or 
narrow-minded is of no importance: the world belongs to them. 
The persistent will-force they possess is an immensely rare and 
immensely powerful faculty to which everything yields. What a 
strong and continuous will is capable of is not always properly 
appreciated. Nothing resists it; neither nature, gods, nor man. 
The most recent example of what can be effected by a strong and 
continuous will is afforded us by the illustrious man who 
separated the Eastern and Western worlds, and accomplished a task 
that during three thousand years had been attempted in vain by 
the greatest sovereigns. He failed later in an identical 
enterprise, but then had intervened old age, to which everything, 
even the will, succumbs. 
When it is desired to show what may be done by mere strength of 
will, all that is necessary is to relate in detail the history of 
the difficulties that had to be surmounted in connection with the 
cutting of the Suez Canal. An ocular witness, Dr. Cazalis, has 
summed up in a few striking lines the entire story of this great 
work, recounted by its immortal author. 
""From day to day, episode by episode, he told the stupendous 
story of the canal. He told of all he had had to vanquish, of 
the impossible he had made possible, of all the opposition he 
encountered, of the coalition against him, and the 
disappointments, the reverses, the defeats which had been 
unavailing to discourage or depress him. He recalled how England 
had combatted him, attacking him without cessation, how Egypt and 
France had hesitated, how the French Consul had been foremost in 
his opposition to the early stages of the work, and the nature of 
the opposition he had met with, the attempt to force his workmen 
to desert from thirst by refusing them fresh water; how the 
Minister of Marine and the engineers, all responsible men of 
experienced and scientific training, had naturally all been 
hostile, were all certain on scientific grounds that disaster was 
at hand, had calculated its coming, foretelling it for such a day 
and hour as an eclipse is foretold."" 
The book which relates the lives of all these great leaders would 
not contain many names, but these names have been bound up with 
the most important events in the history of civilisation. 
2. THE MEANS OF ACTION OF THE LEADERS: AFFIRMATION, REPETITION, CONTAGION 
When it is wanted to stir up a crowd for a short space of time, 
to induce it to commit an act of any nature--to pillage a palace, 
or to die in defence of a stronghold or a barricade, for 
instance--the crowd must be acted upon by rapid suggestion, among 
which example is the most powerful in its effect. To attain this 
end, however, it is necessary that the crowd should have been 
previously prepared by certain circumstances, and, above all, 
that he who wishes to work upon it should possess the quality to 
be studied farther on, to which I give the name of prestige. 
When, however, it is proposed to imbue the mind of a crowd with 
ideas and beliefs--with modern social theories, for instance--the 
leaders have recourse to different expedients. The principal of 
them are three in number and clearly defined--affirmation, 
repetition, and contagion. Their action is somewhat slow, but 
its effects, once produced, are very lasting. 
Affirmation pure and simple, kept free of all reasoning and all 
proof, is one of the surest means of making an idea enter the 
mind of crowds. The conciser an affirmation is, the more 
destitute of every appearance of proof and demonstration, the 
more weight it carries. The religious books and the legal codes 
of all ages have always resorted to simple affirmation. 
Statesmen called upon to defend a political cause, and commercial 
men pushing the sale of their products by means of advertising 
are acquainted with the value of affirmation. 
Affirmation, however, has no real influence unless it be 
constantly repeated, and so far as possible in the same terms. 
It was Napoleon, I believe, who said that there is only one 
figure in rhetoric of serious importance, namely, repetition. 
The thing affirmed comes by repetition to fix itself in the mind 
in such a way that it is accepted in the end as a demonstrated 
truth. 
The influence of repetition on crowds is comprehensible when the 
power is seen which it exercises on the most enlightened minds. 
This power is due to the fact that the repeated statement is 
embedded in the long run in those profound regions of our 
unconscious selves in which the motives of our actions are 
forged. At the end of a certain time we have forgotten who is 
the author of the repeated assertion, and we finish by believing 
it. To this circumstance is due the astonishing power of 
advertisements. When we have read a hundred, a thousand, times 
that X's chocolate is the best, we imagine we have heard it said 
in many quarters, and we end by acquiring the certitude that such 
is the fact. When we have read a thousand times that Y's flour 
has cured the most illustrious persons of the most obstinate 
maladies, we are tempted at last to try it when suffering from an 
illness of a similar kind. If we always read in the same papers 
that A is an arrant scamp and B a most honest man we finish by 
being convinced that this is the truth, unless, indeed, we are 
given to reading another paper of the contrary opinion, in which 
the two qualifications are reversed. Affirmation and repetition 
are alone powerful enough to combat each other. 
When an affirmation has been sufficiently repeated and there is 
unanimity in this repetition--as has occurred in the case of 
certain famous financial undertakings rich enough to purchase 
every assistance-- what is called a current of opinion is formed 
and the powerful mechanism of contagion intervenes. Ideas, 
sentiments, emotions, and beliefs possess in crowds a contagious 
power as intense as that of microbes. This phenomenon is very 
natural, since it is observed even in animals when they are 
together in number. Should a horse in a stable take to biting 
his manger the other horses in the stable will imitate him. A 
panic that has seized on a few sheep will soon extend to the 
whole flock. In the case of men collected in a crowd all 
emotions are very rapidly contagious, which explains the 
suddenness of panics. Brain disorders, like madness, are 
themselves contagious. The frequency of madness among doctors 
who are specialists for the mad is notorious. Indeed, forms of 
madness have recently been cited--agoraphobia, for 
instance--which are communicable from men to animals. 
For individuals to succumb to contagion their simultaneous 
presence on the same spot is not indispensable. The action of 
contagion may be felt from a distance under the influence of 
events which give all minds an individual trend and the 
characteristics peculiar to crowds. This is especially the case 
when men's minds have been prepared to undergo the influence in 
question by those remote factors of which I have made a study 
above. An example in point is the revolutionary movement of 
1848, which, after breaking out in Paris, spread rapidly over a 
great part of Europe and shook a number of thrones. 
Imitation, to which so much influence is attributed in social 
phenomena, is in reality a mere effect of contagion. Having 
shown its influence elsewhere, I shall confine myself to 
reproducing what I said on the subject fifteen years ago. My 
remarks have since been developed by other writers in recent 
publications. 
""Man, like animals, has a natural tendency to imitation. 
Imitation is a necessity for him, provided always that the 
imitation is quite easy. It is this necessity that makes the 
influence of what is called fashion so powerful. Whether in the 
matter of opinions, ideas, literary manifestations, or merely of 
dress, how many persons are bold enough to run counter to the 
fashion? It is by examples not by arguments that crowds are 
guided. At every period there exists a small number of 
individualities which react upon the remainder and are imitated 
by the unconscious mass. It is needful however, that these 
individualities should not be in too pronounced disagreement with 
received ideas. Were they so, to imitate them would be too 
difficult and their influence would be nil. For this very reason 
men who are too superior to their epoch are generally without 
influence upon it. The line of separation is too strongly 
marked. For the same reason too Europeans, in spite of all the 
advantages of their civilisation, have so insignificant an 
influence on Eastern people; they differ from them to too great 
an extent. 
""The dual action of the past and of reciprocal imitation renders, 
in the long run, all the men of the same country and the same 
period so alike that even in the case of individuals who would 
seem destined to escape this double influence, such as 
philosophers, learned men, and men of letters, thought and style 
have a family air which enables the age to which they belong to 
be immediately recognised. It is not necessary to talk for long 
with an individual to attain to a thorough knowledge of what he 
reads, of his habitual occupations, and of the surroundings amid 
which he lives.""[17] 
[17] Gustave le Bon, ""L'Homme et les Societes,"" vol. ii. p. 116. 
1881. 
Contagion is so powerful that it forces upon individuals not only 
certain opinions, but certain modes of feeling as well. 
Contagion is the cause of the contempt in which, at a given 
period, certain works are held--the example of ""Tannhauser"" may 
be cited--which, a few years later, for the same reason are 
admired by those who were foremost in criticising them. 
The opinions and beliefs of crowds are specially propagated by 
contagion, but never by reasoning. The conceptions at present 
rife among the working classes have been acquired at the 
public-house as the result of affirmation, repetition, and 
contagion, and indeed the mode of creation of the beliefs of 
crowds of every age has scarcely been different. Renan justly 
institutes a comparison between the first founders of 
Christianity and ""the socialist working men spreading their ideas 
from public-house to public-house""; while Voltaire had already 
observed in connection with the Christian religion that ""for more 
than a hundred years it was only embraced by the vilest 
riff-raff."" 
It will be noted that in cases analogous to those I have just 
cited, contagion, after having been at work among the popular 
classes, has spread to the higher classes of society. This is 
what we see happening at the present day with regard to the 
socialist doctrines which are beginning to be held by those who 
will yet be their first victims. Contagion is so powerful a 
force that even the sentiment of personal interest disappears 
under its action. 
This is the explanation of the fact that every opinion adopted by 
the populace always ends in implanting itself with great vigour 
in the highest social strata, however obvious be the absurdity of 
the triumphant opinion. This reaction of the lower upon the 
higher social classes is the more curious, owing to the 
circumstance that the beliefs of the crowd always have their 
origin to a greater or less extent in some higher idea, which has 
often remained without influence in the sphere in which it was 
evolved. Leaders and agitators, subjugated by this higher idea, 
take hold of it, distort it and create a sect which distorts it 
afresh, and then propagates it amongst the masses, who carry the 
process of deformation still further. Become a popular truth the 
idea returns, as it were, to its source and exerts an influence 
on the upper classes of a nation. In the long run it is 
intelligence that shapes the destiny of the world, but very 
indirectly. The philosophers who evolve ideas have long since 
returned to dust, when, as the result of the process I have just 
described, the fruit of their reflection ends by triumphing. 
3. PRESTIGE 
Great power is given to ideas propagated by affirmation, 
repetition, and contagion by the circumstance that they acquire 
in time that mysterious force known as prestige. 
Whatever has been a ruling power in the world, whether it be 
ideas or men, has in the main enforced its authority by means of 
that irresistible force expressed by the word ""prestige.""  The 
term is one whose meaning is grasped by everybody, but the word 
is employed in ways too different for it to be easy to define it. 
Prestige may involve such sentiments as admiration or fear. 
Occasionally even these sentiments are its basis, but it can 
perfectly well exist without them. The greatest measure of 
prestige is possessed by the dead, by beings, that is, of whom we 
do not stand in fear--by Alexander, Caesar, Mahomet, and Buddha, 
for example. On the other hand, there are fictive beings whom we 
do not admire--the monstrous divinities of the subterranean 
temples of India, for instance--but who strike us nevertheless as 
endowed with a great prestige. 
Prestige in reality is a sort of domination exercised on our mind 
by an individual, a work, or an idea. This domination entirely 
paralyses our critical faculty, and fills our soul with 
astonishment and respect. The sentiment provoked is 
inexplicable, like all sentiments, but it would appear to be of 
the same kind as the fascination to which a magnetised person is 
subjected. Prestige is the mainspring of all authority. Neither 
gods, kings, nor women have ever reigned without it. 
The various kinds of prestige may be grouped under two principal 
heads: acquired prestige and personal prestige. Acquired 
prestige is that resulting from name, fortune, and reputation. 
It may be independent of personal prestige. Personal prestige, 
on the contrary, is something essentially peculiar to the 
individual; it may coexist with reputation, glory, and fortune, 
or be strengthened by them, but it is perfectly capable of 
existing in their absence. 
Acquired or artificial prestige is much the most common. The 
mere fact that an individual occupies a certain position, 
possesses a certain fortune, or bears certain titles, endows him 
with prestige, however slight his own personal worth. A soldier 
in uniform, a judge in his robes, always enjoys prestige. Pascal 
has very properly noted the necessity for judges of robes and 
wigs. Without them they would be stripped of half their 
authority. The most unbending socialist is always somewhat 
impressed by the sight of a prince or a marquis; and the 
assumption of such titles makes the robbing of tradesmen an easy 
matter.[18] 
[18] The influence of titles, decorations, and uniforms on crowds 
is to be traced in all countries, even in those in which the 
sentiment of personal independence is the most strongly 
developed. I quote in this connection a curious passage from a 
recent book of travel, on the prestige enjoyed in England by 
great persons. 
""I had observed, under various circumstances, the peculiar sort 
of intoxication produced in the most reasonable Englishmen by the 
contact or sight of an English peer. 
""Provided his fortune enables him to keep up his rank, he is sure 
of their affection in advance, and brought into contact with him 
they are so enchanted as to put up with anything at his hands. 
They may be seen to redden with pleasure at his approach, and if 
he speaks to them their suppressed joy increases their redness, 
and causes their eyes to gleam with unusual brilliance. Respect 
for nobility is in their blood, so to speak, as with Spaniards 
the love of dancing, with Germans that of music, and with 
Frenchmen the liking for revolutions. Their passion for horses 
and Shakespeare is less violent, the satisfaction and pride they 
derive from these sources a less integral part of their being. 
There is a considerable sale for books dealing with the peerage, 
and go where one will they are to be found, like the Bible, in 
all hands."" 
The prestige of which I have just spoken is exercised by persons; 
side by side with it may be placed that exercised by opinions, 
literary and artistic works, &amp;c. Prestige of the latter kind is 
most often merely the result of accumulated repetitions. 
History, literary and artistic history especially, being nothing 
more than the repetition of identical judgments, which nobody 
endeavours to verify, every one ends by repeating what he learnt 
at school, till there come to be names and things which nobody 
would venture to meddle with. For a modern reader the perusal of 
Homer results incontestably in immense boredom; but who would 
venture to say so? The Parthenon, in its present state, is a 
wretched ruin, utterly destitute of interest, but it is endowed 
with such prestige that it does not appear to us as it really is, 
but with all its accompaniment of historic memories. The special 
characteristic of prestige is to prevent us seeing things as they 
are and to entirely paralyse our judgment. Crowds always, and 
individuals as a rule, stand in need of ready-made opinions on 
all subjects. The popularity of these opinions is independent of 
the measure of truth or error they contain, and is solely 
regulated by their prestige. 
I now come to personal prestige. Its nature is very different 
from that of artificial or acquired prestige, with which I have 
just been concerned. It is a faculty independent of all titles, 
of all authority, and possessed by a small number of persons whom 
it enables to exercise a veritably magnetic fascination on those 
around them, although they are socially their equals, and lack 
all ordinary means of domination. They force the acceptance of 
their ideas and sentiments on those about them, and they are 
obeyed as is the tamer of wild beasts by the animal that could 
easily devour him. 
The great leaders of crowds, such as Buddha, Jesus, Mahomet, Joan 
of Arc, and Napoleon, have possessed this form of prestige in a 
high degree, and to this endowment is more particularly due the 
position they attained. Gods, heroes, and dogmas win their way 
in the world of their own inward strength. They are not to be 
discussed: they disappear, indeed, as soon as discussed. 
The great personages I have just cited were in possession of 
their power of fascination long before they became illustrious, 
and would never have become so without it. It is evident, for 
instance, that Napoleon at the zenith of his glory enjoyed an 
immense prestige by the mere fact of his power, but he was 
already endowed in part with this prestige when he was without 
power and completely unknown. When, an obscure general, he was 
sent, thanks to influential protection, to command the army of 
Italy, he found himself among rough generals who were of a mind 
to give a hostile reception to the young intruder dispatched them 
by the Directory. From the very beginning, from the first 
interview, without the aid of speeches, gestures, or threats, at 
the first sight of the man who was to become great they were 
vanquished. Taine furnishes a curious account of this interview 
taken from contemporary memoirs. 
""The generals of division, amongst others Augereau, a sort of 
swashbuckler, uncouth and heroic, proud of his height and his 
bravery, arrive at the staff quarters very badly disposed towards 
the little upstart dispatched them from Paris. On the strength 
of the description of him that has been given them, Augereau is 
inclined to be insolent and insubordinate; a favourite of Barras, 
a general who owes his rank to the events of Vendemiaire who has 
won his grade by street-fighting, who is looked upon as bearish, 
because he is always thinking in solitude, of poor aspect, and 
with the reputation of a mathematician and dreamer. They are 
introduced, and Bonaparte keeps them waiting. At last he 
appears, girt with his sword; he puts on his hat, explains the 
measures he has taken, gives his orders, and dismisses them. 
Augereau has remained silent; it is only when he is outside that 
he regains his self-possession and is able to deliver himself of 
his customary oaths. He admits with Massena that this little 
devil of a general has inspired him with awe; he cannot 
understand the ascendency by which from the very first he has 
felt himself overwhelmed."" 
Become a great man, his prestige increased in proportion as his 
glory grew, and came to be at least equal to that of a divinity 
in the eyes of those devoted to him. General Vandamme, a rough, 
typical soldier of the Revolution, even more brutal and energetic 
than Augereau, said of him to Marshal d'Arnano in 1815, as on one 
occasion they mounted together the stairs of the Tuileries: 
""That devil of a man exercises a fascination on me that I cannot 
explain even to myself, and in such a degree that, though I fear 
neither God nor devil, when I am in his presence I am ready to 
tremble like a child, and he could make me go through the eye of 
a needle to throw myself into the fire."" 
Napoleon exercised a like fascination on all who came into 
contact with him.[19] 
[19] Thoroughly conscious of his prestige, Napoleon was aware 
that he added to it by treating rather worse than stable lads the 
great personages around him, and among whom figured some of those 
celebrated men of the Convention of whom Europe had stood in 
dread. The gossip of the period abounds in illustrations of this 
fact. One day, in the midst of a Council of State, Napoleon 
grossly insults Beugnot, treating him as one might an unmannerly 
valet. The effect produced, he goes up to him and says, ""Well, 
stupid, have you found your head again?""  Whereupon Beugnot, tall 
as a drum-major, bows very low, and the little man raising his 
hand, takes the tall one by the ear, ""an intoxicating sign of 
favour,"" writes Beugnot, ""the familiar gesture of the master who 
waxes gracious.""  Such examples give a clear idea of the degree 
of base platitude that prestige can provoke. They enable us to 
understand the immense contempt of the great despot for the men 
surrounding him--men whom he merely looked upon as ""food for 
powder."" 
Davoust used to say, talking of Maret's devotion and of his own: 
""Had the Emperor said to us, `It is important in the interest of 
my policy that Paris should be destroyed without a single person 
leaving it or escaping,' Maret I am sure would have kept the 
secret, but he could not have abstained from compromising himself 
by seeing that his family got clear of the city. On the other 
hand, I, for fear of letting the truth leak out, would have let 
my wife and children stay."" 
It is necessary to bear in mind the astounding power exerted by 
fascination of this order to understand that marvellous return 
from the Isle of Elba, that lightning-like conquest of France by 
an isolated man confronted by all the organised forces of a great 
country that might have been supposed weary of his tyranny. He 
had merely to cast a look at the generals sent to lay hands on 
him, and who had sworn to accomplish their mission. All of them 
submitted without discussion. 
""Napoleon,"" writes the English General Wolseley, ""lands in France 
almost alone, a fugitive from the small island of Elba which was 
his kingdom, and succeeded in a few weeks, without bloodshed, in 
upsetting all organised authority in France under its legitimate 
king; is it possible for the personal ascendency of a man to 
affirm itself in a more astonishing manner? But from the 
beginning to the end of this campaign, which was his last, how 
remarkable too is the ascendency he exercised over the Allies, 
obliging them to follow his initiative, and how near he came to 
crushing them!"" 
His prestige outlived him and continued to grow. It is his 
prestige that made an emperor of his obscure nephew. How 
powerful is his memory still is seen in the resurrection of his 
legend in progress at the present day. Ill-treat men as you 
will, massacre them by millions, be the cause of invasion upon 
invasion, all is permitted you if you possess prestige in a 
sufficient degree and the talent necessary to uphold it. 
I have invoked, no doubt, in this case a quite exceptional 
example of prestige, but one it was useful to cite to make clear 
the genesis of great religions, great doctrines, and great 
empires. Were it not for the power exerted on the crowd by 
prestige, such growths would be incomprehensible. 
Prestige, however, is not based solely on personal ascendency, 
military glory, and religious terror; it may have a more modest 
origin and still be considerable. Our century furnishes several 
examples. One of the most striking ones that posterity will 
recall from age to age will be supplied by the history of the 
illustrious man who modified the face of the globe and the 
commercial relations of the nations by separating two continents. 
He succeeded in his enterprise owing to his immense strength of 
will, but also owing to the fascination he exercised on those 
surrounding him. To overcome the unanimous opposition he met 
with, he had only to show himself. He would speak briefly, and 
in face of the charm he exerted his opponents became his friends. 
The English in particular strenuously opposed his scheme; he had 
only to put in an appearance in England to rally all suffrages. 
In later years, when he passed Southampton, the bells were rung 
on his passage; and at the present day a movement is on foot in 
England to raise a statue in his honour. 
""Having vanquished whatever there is to vanquish, men and things, 
marshes, rocks, and sandy wastes,"" he had ceased to believe in 
obstacles, and wished to begin Suez over again at Panama. He 
began again with the same methods as of old; but he had aged, 
and, besides, the faith that moves mountains does not move them 
if they are too lofty. The mountains resisted, and the 
catastrophe that ensued destroyed the glittering aureole of glory 
that enveloped the hero. His life teaches how prestige can grow 
and how it can vanish. After rivalling in greatness the most 
famous heroes of history, he was lowered by the magistrates of 
his country to the ranks of the vilest criminals. When he died 
his coffin, unattended, traversed an indifferent crowd. Foreign 
sovereigns are alone in rendering homage to his memory as to that 
of one of the greatest men that history has known.[20] 
[20] An Austrian paper, the Neue Freie Presse, of Vienna, has 
indulged on the subject of the destiny of de Lesseps in 
reflections marked by a most judicious psychological insight. I 
therefore reproduce them here:-- 
""After the condemnation of Ferdinand de Lesseps one has no longer 
the right to be astonished at the sad end of Christopher 
Columbus. If Ferdinand de Lesseps were a rogue every noble 
illusion is a crime. Antiquity would have crowned the memory of 
de Lesseps with an aureole of glory, and would have made him 
drink from the bowl of nectar in the midst of Olympus, for he has 
altered the face of the earth and accomplished works which make 
the creation more perfect. The President of the Court of Appeal 
has immortalised himself by condemning Ferdinand de Lesseps, for 
the nations will always demand the name of the man who was not 
afraid to debase his century by investing with the convict's cap 
an aged man, whose life redounded to the glory of his 
contemporaries. 
""Let there be no more talk in the future of inflexible justice, 
there where reigns a bureaucratic hatred of audacious feats. The 
nations have need of audacious men who believe in themselves and 
overcome every obstacle without concern for their personal 
safety. Genius cannot be prudent; by dint of prudence it could 
never enlarge the sphere of human activity. 
"". . . Ferdinand de Lesseps has known the intoxication of triumph 
and the bitterness of disappointment--Suez and Panama. At this 
point the heart revolts at the morality of success. When de 
Lesseps had succeeded in joining two seas princes and nations 
rendered him their homage; to-day, when he meets with failure 
among the rocks of the Cordilleras, he is nothing but a vulgar 
rogue. . . . In this result we see a war between the classes of 
society, the discontent of bureaucrats and employes, who take 
their revenge with the aid of the criminal code on those who 
would raise themselves above their fellows. . . . Modern 
legislators are filled with embarrassment when confronted by the 
lofty ideas due to human genius; the public comprehends such 
ideas still less, and it is easy for an advocate-general to prove 
that Stanley is a murderer and de Lesseps a deceiver."" 
Still, the various examples that have just been cited represent 
extreme cases. To fix in detail the psychology of prestige, it 
would be necessary to place them at the extremity of a series, 
which would range from the founders of religions and empires to 
the private individual who endeavours to dazzle his neighbours by 
a new coat or a decoration. 
Between the extreme limits of this series would find a place all 
the forms of prestige resulting from the different elements 
composing a civilisation--sciences, arts, literature, &amp;c.--and it 
would be seen that prestige constitutes the fundamental element 
of persuasion. Consciously or not, the being, the idea, or the 
thing possessing prestige is immediately imitated in consequence 
of contagion, and forces an entire generation to adopt certain 
modes of feeling and of giving expression to its thought. This 
imitation, moreover, is, as a rule, unconscious, which accounts 
for the fact that it is perfect. The modern painters who copy 
the pale colouring and the stiff attitudes of some of the 
Primitives are scarcely alive to the source of their inspiration. 
They believe in their own sincerity, whereas, if an eminent 
master had not revived this form of art, people would have 
continued blind to all but its naive and inferior sides. Those 
artists who, after the manner of another illustrious master, 
inundate their canvasses with violet shades do not see in nature 
more violet than was detected there fifty years ago; but they are 
influenced, ""suggestioned,"" by the personal and special 
impressions of a painter who, in spite of this eccentricity, was 
successful in acquiring great prestige. Similar examples might 
be brought forward in connection with all the elements of 
civilisation. 
It is seen from what precedes that a number of factors may be 
concerned in the genesis of prestige; among them success was 
always one of the most important. Every successful man, every 
idea that forces itself into recognition, ceases, ipso facto, to 
be called in question. The proof that success is one of the 
principal stepping-stones to prestige is that the disappearance 
of the one is almost always followed by the disappearance of the 
other. The hero whom the crowd acclaimed yesterday is insulted 
to-day should he have been overtaken by failure. The reaction, 
indeed, will be the stronger in proportion as the prestige has 
been great. The crowd in this case considers the fallen hero as 
an equal, and takes its revenge for having bowed to a superiority 
whose existence it no longer admits. While Robespierre was 
causing the execution of his colleagues and of a great number of 
his contemporaries, he possessed an immense prestige. When the 
transposition of a few votes deprived him of power, he 
immediately lost his prestige, and the crowd followed him to the 
guillotine with the self-same imprecations with which shortly 
before it had pursued his victims. Believers always break the 
statues of their former gods with every symptom of fury. 
Prestige lost by want of success disappears in a brief space of 
time. It can also be worn away, but more slowly by being 
subjected to discussion. This latter power, however, is 
exceedingly sure. From the moment prestige is called in question 
it ceases to be prestige. The gods and men who have kept their 
prestige for long have never tolerated discussion. For the crowd 
to admire, it must be kept at a distance. 
CHAPTER IV 
LIMITATIONS OF THE VARIABILITY OF THE BELIEFS AND OPINIONS OF CROWDS 
1. FIXED BELIEFS. The invariability of certain general 
beliefs--They shape the course of a civilisation--The difficulty 
of uprooting them--In what respect intolerance is a virtue in a 
people--The philosophic absurdity of a belief cannot interfere 
with its spreading.  2. THE CHANGEABLE OPINIONS OF CROWDS. 
The extreme mobility of opinions which do not arise from general 
beliefs--Apparent variations of ideas and beliefs in less than a 
century--The real limits of these variations--The matters 
effected by the variation--The disappearance at present in 
progress of general beliefs, and the extreme diffusion of the 
newspaper press, have for result that opinions are nowadays more 
and more changeable--Why the opinions of crowds tend on the 
majority of subjects towards indifference--Governments now 
powerless to direct opinion as they formerly did--Opinions 
prevented to-day from being tyrannical on account of their 
exceeding divergency. 
1. FIXED BELIEFS 
A close parallel exists between the anatomical and psychological 
characteristics of living beings. In these anatomical 
characteristics certain invariable, or slightly variable, 
elements are met with, to change which the lapse is necessary of 
geological ages. Side by side with these fixed, indestructible 
features are to be found others extremely changeable, which the 
art of the breeder or horticulturist may easily modify, and at 
times to such an extent as to conceal the fundamental 
characteristics from an observer at all inattentive. 
The same phenomenon is observed in the case of moral 
characteristics. Alongside the unalterable psychological 
elements of a race, mobile and changeable elements are to be 
encountered. For this reason, in studying the beliefs and 
opinions of a people, the presence is always detected of a fixed 
groundwork on which are engrafted opinions as changing as the 
surface sand on a rock. 
The opinions and beliefs of crowds may be divided, then, into two 
very distinct classes. On the one hand we have great permanent 
beliefs, which endure for several centuries, and on which an 
entire civilisation may rest. Such, for instance, in the past 
were feudalism, Christianity, and Protestantism; and such, in our 
own time, are the nationalist principle and contemporary 
democratic and social ideas. In the second place, there are the 
transitory, changing opinions, the outcome, as a rule, of general 
conceptions, of which every age sees the birth and disappearance; 
examples in point are the theories which mould literature and the 
arts--those, for instance, which produced romanticism, 
naturalism, mysticism, &amp;c. Opinions of this order are as 
superficial, as a rule, as fashion, and as changeable. They may 
be compared to the ripples which ceaselessly arise and vanish on 
the surface of a deep lake. 
The great generalised beliefs are very restricted in number. 
Their rise and fall form the culminating points of the history of 
every historic race. They constitute the real framework of 
civilisation. 
It is easy to imbue the mind of crowds with a passing opinion, 
but very difficult to implant therein a lasting belief. However, 
a belief of this latter description once established, it is 
equally difficult to uproot it. It is usually only to be changed 
at the cost of violent revolutions. Even revolutions can only 
avail when the belief has almost entirely lost its sway over 
men's minds. In that case revolutions serve to finally sweep 
away what had already been almost cast aside, though the force of 
habit prevented its complete abandonment. The beginning of a 
revolution is in reality the end of a belief. 
The precise moment at which a great belief is doomed is easily 
recognisable; it is the moment when its value begins to be called 
in question. Every general belief being little else than a 
fiction, it can only survive on the condition that it be not 
subjected to examination. 
But even when a belief is severely shaken, the institutions to 
which it has given rise retain their strength and disappear but 
slowly. Finally, when the belief has completely lost its force, 
all that rested upon it is soon involved in ruin. As yet a 
nation has never been able to change its beliefs without being 
condemned at the same time to transform all the elements of its 
civilisation. The nation continues this process of 
transformation until it has alighted on and accepted a new 
general belief: until this juncture it is perforce in a state of 
anarchy. General beliefs are the indispensable pillars of 
civilisations; they determine the trend of ideas. They alone are 
capable of inspiring faith and creating a sense of duty. 
Nations have always been conscious of the utility of acquiring 
general beliefs, and have instinctively understood that their 
disappearance would be the signal for their own decline. In the 
case of the Romans, the fanatical cult of Rome was the belief 
that made them masters of the world, and when the belief had died 
out Rome was doomed to die. As for the barbarians who destroyed 
the Roman civilisation, it was only when they had acquired 
certain commonly accepted beliefs that they attained a measure of 
cohesion and emerged from anarchy. 
Plainly it is not for nothing that nations have always displayed 
intolerance in the defence of their opinions. This intolerance, 
open as it is to criticism from the philosophic standpoint, 
represents in the life of a people the most necessary of virtues. 
It was to found or uphold general beliefs that so many victims 
were sent to the stake in the Middle Ages and that so many 
inventors and innovators have died in despair even if they have 
escaped martyrdom. It is in defence, too, of such beliefs that 
the world has been so often the scene of the direst disorder, and 
that so many millions of men have died on the battlefield, and 
will yet die there. 
There are great difficulties in the way of establishing a general 
belief, but when it is definitely implanted its power is for a 
long time to come invincible, and however false it be 
philosophically it imposes itself upon the most luminous 
intelligence. Have not the European peoples regarded as 
incontrovertible for more than fifteen centuries religious 
legends which, closely examined, are as barbarous[21] as those of 
Moloch? The frightful absurdity of the legend of a God who 
revenges himself for the disobedience of one of his creatures by 
inflicting horrible tortures on his son remained unperceived 
during many centuries. Such potent geniuses as a Galileo, a 
Newton, and a Leibnitz never supposed for an instant that the 
truth of such dogmas could be called in question. Nothing can be 
more typical than this fact of the hypnotising effect of general 
beliefs, but at the same time nothing can mark more decisively 
the humiliating limitations of our intelligence. 
[21] Barbarous, philosophically speaking, I mean. In practice 
they have created an entirely new civilisation, and for fifteen 
centuries have given mankind a glimpse of those enchanted realms 
of generous dreams and of hope which he will know no more. 
As soon as a new dogma is implanted in the mind of crowds it 
becomes the source of inspiration whence are evolved its 
institutions, arts, and mode of existence. The sway it exerts 
over men's minds under these circumstances is absolute. Men of 
action have no thought beyond realising the accepted belief, 
legislators beyond applying it, while philosophers, artists, and 
men of letters are solely preoccupied with its expression under 
various shapes. 
From the fundamental belief transient accessory ideas may arise, 
but they always bear the impress of the belief from which they 
have sprung. The Egyptian civilisation, the European 
civilisation of the Middle Ages, the Mussulman civilisation of 
the Arabs are all the outcome of a small number of religious 
beliefs which have left their mark on the least important 
elements of these civilisations and allow of their immediate 
recognition. 
Thus it is that, thanks to general beliefs, the men of every age 
are enveloped in a network of traditions, opinions, and customs 
which render them all alike, and from whose yoke they cannot 
extricate themselves. Men are guided in their conduct above all 
by their beliefs and by the customs that are the consequence of 
those beliefs. These beliefs and customs regulate the smallest 
acts of our existence, and the most independent spirit cannot 
escape their influence. The tyranny exercised unconsciously on 
men's minds is the only real tyranny, because it cannot be fought 
against. Tiberius, Ghengis Khan, and Napoleon were assuredly 
redoubtable tyrants, but from the depth of their graves Moses, 
Buddha, Jesus, and Mahomet have exerted on the human soul a far 
profounder despotism. A conspiracy may overthrow a tyrant, but 
what can it avail against a firmly established belief? In its 
violent struggle with Roman Catholicism it is the French 
Revolution that has been vanquished, and this in spite of the 
fact that the sympathy of the crowd was apparently on its side, 
and in spite of recourse to destructive measures as pitiless as 
those of the Inquisition. The only real tyrants that humanity 
has known have always been the memories of its dead or the 
illusions it has forged itself. 
The philosophic absurdity that often marks general beliefs has 
never been an obstacle to their triumph. Indeed the triumph of 
such beliefs would seem impossible unless on the condition that 
they offer some mysterious absurdity. In consequence, the 
evident weakness of the socialist beliefs of to-day will not 
prevent them triumphing among the masses. Their real inferiority 
to all religious beliefs is solely the result of this 
consideration, that the ideal of happiness offered by the latter 
being realisable only in a future life, it was beyond the power 
of anybody to contest it. The socialist ideal of happiness being 
intended to be realised on earth, the vanity of its promises will 
at once appear as soon as the first efforts towards their 
realisation are made, and simultaneously the new belief will 
entirely lose its prestige. Its strength, in consequence, will 
only increase until the day when, having triumphed, its practical 
realisation shall commence. For this reason, while the new 
religion exerts to begin with, like all those that have preceded 
it, a destructive influence, it will be unable, in the future, to 
play a creative part. 
2. THE CHANGEABLE OPINIONS OF CROWDS 
Above the substratum of fixed beliefs, whose power we have just 
demonstrated, is found an overlying growth of opinions, ideas, 
and thoughts which are incessantly springing up and dying out. 
Some of them exist but for a day, and the more important scarcely 
outlive a generation. We have already noted that the changes 
which supervene in opinions of this order are at times far more 
superficial than real, and that they are always affected by 
racial considerations. When examining, for instance, the 
political institutions of France we showed that parties to all 
appearance utterly distinct--royalists, radicals, imperialists, 
socialists, &amp;c.--have an ideal absolutely identical, and that 
this ideal is solely dependent on the mental structure of the 
French race, since a quite contrary ideal is found under 
analogous names among other races. Neither the name given to 
opinions nor deceptive adaptations alter the essence of things. 
The men of the Great Revolution, saturated with Latin literature, 
who (their eyes fixed on the Roman Republic), adopted its laws, 
its fasces, and its togas, did not become Romans because they 
were under the empire of a powerful historical suggestion. The 
task of the philosopher is to investigate what it is which 
subsists of ancient beliefs beneath their apparent changes, and 
to identify amid the moving flux of opinions the part determined 
by general beliefs and the genius of the race. 
In the absence of this philosophic test it might be supposed that 
crowds change their political or religious beliefs frequently and 
at will. All history, whether political, religious, artistic, or 
literary, seems to prove that such is the case. 
As an example, let us take a very short period of French history, 
merely that from 1790 to 1820, a period of thirty years' 
duration, that of a generation. In the course of it we see the 
crowd at first monarchical become very revolutionary, then very 
imperialist, and again very monarchical. In the matter of 
religion it gravitates in the same lapse of time from Catholicism 
to atheism, then towards deism, and then returns to the most 
pronounced forms of Catholicism. These changes take place not 
only amongst the masses, but also amongst those who direct them. 
We observe with astonishment the prominent men of the Convention, 
the sworn enemies of kings, men who would have neither gods nor 
masters, become the humble servants of Napoleon, and afterwards, 
under Louis XVIII., piously carry candles in religious 
processions. 
Numerous, too, are the changes in the opinions of the crowd in 
the course of the following seventy years. The ""Perfidious 
Albion"" of the opening of the century is the ally of France under 
Napoleon's heir; Russia, twice invaded by France, which looked on 
with satisfaction at French reverses, becomes its friend. 
In literature, art, and philosophy the successive evolutions of 
opinion are more rapid still. Romanticism, naturalism, 
mysticism, &amp;c., spring up and die out in turn. The artist and 
the writer applauded yesterday are treated on the morrow with 
profound contempt. 
When, however, we analyse all these changes in appearance so far 
reaching, what do we find? All those that are in opposition with 
the general beliefs and sentiments of the race are of transient 
duration, and the diverted stream soon resumes its course. The 
opinions which are not linked to any general belief or sentiment 
of the race, and which in consequence cannot possess stability, 
are at the mercy of every chance, or, if the expression be 
preferred, of every change in the surrounding circumstances. 
Formed by suggestion and contagion, they are always momentary; 
they crop up and disappear as rapidly on occasion as the 
sandhills formed by the wind on the sea-coast. 
At the present day the changeable opinions of crowds are greater 
in number than they ever were, and for three different reasons. 
The first is that as the old beliefs are losing their influence 
to a greater and greater extent, they are ceasing to shape the 
ephemeral opinions of the moment as they did in the past. The 
weakening of general beliefs clears the ground for a crop of 
haphazard opinions without a past or a future. 
The second reason is that the power of crowds being on the 
increase, and this power being less and less counterbalanced, the 
extreme mobility of ideas, which we have seen to be a peculiarity 
of crowds, can manifest itself without let or hindrance. 
Finally, the third reason is the recent development of the 
newspaper press, by whose agency the most contrary opinions are 
being continually brought before the attention of crowds. The 
suggestions that might result from each individual opinion are 
soon destroyed by suggestions of an opposite character. The 
consequence is that no opinion succeeds in becoming widespread, 
and that the existence of all of them is ephemeral. An opinion 
nowadays dies out before it has found a sufficiently wide 
acceptance to become general. 
A phenomenon quite new in the world's history, and most 
characteristic of the present age, has resulted from these 
different causes; I allude to the powerlessness of governments to 
direct opinion. 
In the past, and in no very distant past, the action of 
governments and the influence of a few writers and a very small 
number of newspapers constituted the real reflectors of public 
opinion. To-day the writers have lost all influence, and the 
newspapers only reflect opinion. As for statesmen, far from 
directing opinion, their only endeavour is to follow it. They 
have a dread of opinion, which amounts at times to terror, and 
causes them to adopt an utterly unstable line of conduct. 
The opinion of crowds tends, then, more and more to become the 
supreme guiding principle in politics. It goes so far to-day as 
to force on alliances, as has been seen recently in the case of 
the Franco-Russian alliance, which is solely the outcome of a 
popular movement. A curious symptom of the present time is to 
observe popes, kings, and emperors consent to be interviewed as a 
means of submitting their views on a given subject to the 
judgment of crowds. Formerly it might have been correct to say 
that politics were not a matter of sentiment. Can the same be 
said to-day, when politics are more and more swayed by the 
impulse of changeable crowds, who are uninfluenced by reason and 
can only be guided by sentiment? 
As to the press, which formerly directed opinion, it has had, 
like governments, to humble itself before the power of crowds. 
It wields, no doubt, a considerable influence, but only because 
it is exclusively the reflection of the opinions of crowds and of 
their incessant variations. Become a mere agency for the supply 
of information, the press has renounced all endeavour to enforce 
an idea or a doctrine. It follows all the changes of public 
thought, obliged to do so by the necessities of competition under 
pain of losing its readers. The old staid and influential organs 
of the past, such as the Constitutionnel, the Debats, or the 
Siecle, which were accepted as oracles by the preceding 
generation, have disappeared or have become typical modern 
papers, in which a maximum of news is sandwiched in between light 
articles, society gossip, and financial puffs. There can be no 
question to-day of a paper rich enough to allow its contributors 
to air their personal opinions, and such opinions would be of 
slight weight with readers who only ask to be kept informed or to 
be amused, and who suspect every affirmation of being prompted by 
motives of speculation. Even the critics have ceased to be able 
to assure the success of a book or a play. They are capable of 
doing harm, but not of doing a service. The papers are so 
conscious of the uselessness of everything in the shape of 
criticism or personal opinion, that they have reached the point 
of suppressing literary criticism, confining themselves to citing 
the title of a book, and appending a ""puff"" of two or three 
lines.[22]  In twenty years' time the same fate will probably 
have overtaken theatrical criticism. 
[22] These remarks refer to the French newspaper press.--Note of 
the Translator. 
The close watching of the course of opinion has become to-day the 
principal preoccupation of the press and of governments. The 
effect produced by an event, a legislative proposal, a speech, is 
without intermission what they require to know, and the task is 
not easy, for nothing is more mobile and changeable than the 
thought of crowds, and nothing more frequent than to see them 
execrate to-day what they applauded yesterday. 
This total absence of any sort of direction of opinion, and at 
the same time the destruction of general beliefs, have had for 
final result an extreme divergency of convictions of every order, 
and a growing indifference on the part of crowds to everything 
that does not plainly touch their immediate interests. Questions 
of doctrine, such as socialism, only recruit champions boasting 
genuine convictions among the quite illiterate classes, among the 
workers in mines and factories, for instance. Members of the 
lower middle class, and working men possessing some degree of 
instruction, have either become utterly sceptical or extremely 
unstable in their opinions. 
The evolution which has been effected in this direction in the 
last twenty-five years is striking. During the preceding period, 
comparatively near us though it is, opinions still had a certain 
general trend; they had their origin in the acceptance of some 
fundamental belief. By the mere fact that an individual was a 
monarchist he possessed inevitably certain clearly defined ideas 
in history as well as in science, while by the mere fact that he 
was a republican, his ideas were quite contrary. A monarchist 
was well aware that men are not descended from monkeys, and a 
republican was not less well aware that such is in truth their 
descent. It was the duty of the monarchist to speak with horror, 
and of the republican to speak with veneration, of the great 
Revolution. There were certain names, such as those of 
Robespierre and Marat, that had to be uttered with an air of 
religious devotion, and other names, such as those of Caesar, 
Augustus, or Napoleon, that ought never to be mentioned 
unaccompanied by a torrent of invective. Even in the French 
Sorbonne this ingenuous fashion of conceiving history was 
general.[23] 
[23] There are pages in the books of the French official 
professors of history that are very curious from this point of 
view. They prove too how little the critical spirit is developed 
by the system of university education in vogue in France. I cite 
as an example the following extracts from the ""French Revolution"" 
of M. Rambaud, professor of history at the Sorbonne: 
""The taking of the Bastille was a culminating event in the 
history not only of France, but of all Europe; and inaugurated a 
new epoch in the history of the world!"" 
With respect to Robespierre, we learn with stupefaction that ""his 
dictatorship was based more especially on opinion, persuasion, 
and moral authority; it was a sort of pontificate in the hands of 
a virtuous man!"" (pp. 91 and 220.) 
At the present day, as the result of discussion and analysis, all 
opinions are losing their prestige; their distinctive features 
are rapidly worn away, and few survive capable of arousing our 
enthusiasm. The man of modern times is more and more a prey to 
indifference. 
The general wearing away of opinions should not be too greatly 
deplored. That it is a symptom of decadence in the life of a 
people cannot be contested. It is certain that men of immense, 
of almost supernatural insight, that apostles, leaders of 
crowds--men, in a word, of genuine and strong convictions--exert 
a far greater force than men who deny, who criticise, or who are 
indifferent, but it must not be forgotten that, given the power 
possessed at present by crowds, were a single opinion to acquire 
sufficient prestige to enforce its general acceptance, it would 
soon be endowed with so tyrannical a strength that everything 
would have to bend before it, and the era of free discussion 
would be closed for a long time. Crowds are occasionally 
easy-going masters, as were Heliogabalus and Tiberius, but they 
are also violently capricious. A civilisation, when the moment 
has come for crowds to acquire a high hand over it, is at the 
mercy of too many chances to endure for long. Could anything 
postpone for a while the hour of its ruin, it would be precisely 
the extreme instability of the opinions of crowds and their 
growing indifference with respect to all general beliefs. 
BOOK III 
THE CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF 
CROWDS 
CHAPTER I 
THE CLASSIFICATION OF CROWDS 
The general divisions of crowds--Their classification.  1. 
HETEROGENEOUS CROWDS. Different varieties of them--The influence 
of race--The spirit of the crowd is weak in proportion as the 
spirit of the race is strong--The spirit of the race represents 
the civilised state and the spirit of the crowd the barbarian 
state.  2. HOMOGENEOUS CROWDS. Their different 
varieties--Sects, castes, and classes. 
We have sketched in this work the general characteristics common 
to psychological crowds. It remains to point out the particular 
characteristics which accompany those of a general order in the 
different categories of collectivities, when they are transformed 
into a crowd under the influences of the proper exciting causes. 
We will, first of all, set forth in a few words a classification 
of crowds. 
Our starting-point will be the simple multitude. Its most 
inferior form is met with when the multitude is composed of 
individuals belonging to different races. In this case its only 
common bond of union is the will, more or less respected of a 
chief. The barbarians of very diverse origin who during several 
centuries invaded the Roman Empire, may be cited as a specimen of 
multitudes of this kind. 
On a higher level than these multitudes composed of different 
races are those which under certain influences have acquired 
common characteristics, and have ended by forming a single race. 
They present at times characteristics peculiar to crowds, but 
these characteristics are overruled to a greater or less extent 
by racial considerations. 
These two kinds of multitudes may, under certain influences 
investigated in this work, be transformed into organised or 
psychological crowds. We shall break up these organised crowds 
into the following divisions:-- 
						 1. Anonymous crowds (street 
						   crowds, for example). 
A. Heterogeneous		 2. Crowds not anonymous 
	crowds.				(juries, parliamentary assemblies, 
							 &amp;c.). 
						  1. Sects (political sects, 
							 religious sects, &amp;c.). 
						  2. Castes (the military caste, 
B. Homogeneous			   the priestly caste, the 
	crowds.				 working caste, &amp;c.). 
						  3. Classes (the middle classes, 
							 the peasant classes, &amp;c.). 
We will point out briefly the distinguishing characteristics of 
these different categories of crowds. 
1. HETEROGENEOUS CROWDS 
It is these collectivities whose characteristics have been 
studied in this volume. They are composed of individuals of any 
description, of any profession, and any degree of intelligence. 
We are now aware that by the mere fact that men form part of a 
crowd engaged in action, their collective psychology differs 
essentially from their individual psychology, and their 
intelligence is affected by this differentiation. We have seen 
that intelligence is without influence in collectivities, they 
being solely under the sway of unconscious sentiments. 
A fundamental factor, that of race, allows of a tolerably 
thorough differentiation of the various heterogeneous crowds. 
We have often referred already to the part played by race, and 
have shown it to be the most powerful of the factors capable of 
determining men's actions. Its action is also to be traced in 
the character of crowds. A crowd composed of individuals 
assembled at haphazard, but all of them Englishmen or Chinamen, 
will differ widely from another crowd also composed of 
individuals of any and every description, but of other 
races--Russians, Frenchmen, or Spaniards, for example. 
The wide divergencies which their inherited mental constitution 
creates in men's modes of feeling and thinking at once come into 
prominence when, which rarely happens, circumstances gather 
together in the same crowd and in fairly equal proportions 
individuals of different nationality, and this occurs, however 
identical in appearance be the interests which provoked the 
gathering. The efforts made by the socialists to assemble in 
great congresses the representatives of the working-class 
populations of different countries, have always ended in the most 
pronounced discord. A Latin crowd, however revolutionary or 
however conservative it be supposed, will invariably appeal to 
the intervention of the State to realise its demands. It is 
always distinguished by a marked tendency towards centralisation 
and by a leaning, more or less pronounced, in favour of a 
dictatorship. An English or an American crowd, on the contrary, 
sets no store on the State, and only appeals to private 
initiative. A French crowd lays particular weight on equality 
and an English crowd on liberty. These differences of race 
explain how it is that there are almost as many different forms 
of socialism and democracy as there are nations. 
The genius of the race, then, exerts a paramount influence upon 
the dispositions of a crowd. It is the powerful underlying force 
that limits its changes of humour. It should be considered as an 
essential law that THE INFERIOR CHARACTERISTICS OF CROWDS ARE THE 
LESS ACCENTUATED IN PROPORTION AS THE SPIRIT OF THE RACE IS 
STRONG. The crowd state and the domination of crowds is 
equivalent to the barbarian state, or to a return to it. It is 
by the acquisition of a solidly constituted collective spirit 
that the race frees itself to a greater and greater extent from 
the unreflecting power of crowds, and emerges from the barbarian 
state. The only important classification to be made of 
heterogeneous crowds, apart from that based on racial 
considerations, is to separate them into anonymous crowds, such 
as street crowds, and crowds not anonymous--deliberative 
assemblies and juries, for example. The sentiment of 
responsibility absent from crowds of the first description and 
developed in those of the second often gives a very different 
tendency to their respective acts. 
2. HOMOGENEOUS CROWDS 
Homogeneous crowds include: 1. Sects; 2. Castes; 3. Classes. 
The SECT represents the first step in the process of organisation 
of homogeneous crowds. A sect includes individuals differing 
greatly as to their education, their professions, and the class 
of society to which they belong, and with their common beliefs as 
the connecting link. Examples in point are religious and 
political sects. 
The CASTE represents the highest degree of organisation of which 
the crowd is susceptible. While the sect includes individuals of 
very different professions, degrees of education and social 
surrounding, who are only linked together by the beliefs they 
hold in common, the caste is composed of individuals of the same 
profession, and in consequence similarly educated and of much the 
same social status. Examples in point are the military and 
priestly castes. 
The CLASS is formed of individuals of diverse origin, linked 
together not by a community of beliefs, as are the members of a 
sect, or by common professional occupations, as are the members 
of a caste, but by certain interests and certain habits of life 
and education almost identical. The middle class and the 
agricultural class are examples. 
Being only concerned in this work with heterogeneous crowds, and 
reserving the study of homogeneous crowds (sects, castes, and 
classes) for another volume, I shall not insist here on the 
characteristics of crowds of this latter kind. I shall conclude 
this study of heterogeneous crowds by the examination of a few 
typical and distinct categories of crowds. 
CHAPTER II 
CROWDS TERMED CRIMINAL CROWDS 
Crowds termed criminal crowds--A crowd may be legally yet not 
psychologically criminal--The absolute unconsciousness of the 
acts of crowds--Various examples--Psychology of the authors of 
the September massacres--Their reasoning, their sensibility, 
their ferocity, and their morality. 
Owing to the fact that crowds, after a period of excitement, 
enter upon a purely automatic and unconscious state, in which 
they are guided by suggestion, it seems difficult to qualify them 
in any case as criminal. I only retain this erroneous 
qualification because it has been definitely brought into vogue 
by recent psychological investigations. Certain acts of crowds 
are assuredly criminal, if considered merely in themselves, but 
criminal in that case in the same way as the act of a tiger 
devouring a Hindoo, after allowing its young to maul him for 
their amusement. 
The usual motive of the crimes of crowds is a powerful 
suggestion, and the individuals who take part in such crimes are 
afterwards convinced that they have acted in obedience to duty, 
which is far from being the case with the ordinary criminal. 
The history of the crimes committed by crowds illustrates what 
precedes. 
The murder of M. de Launay, the governor of the Bastille, may be 
cited as a typical example. After the taking of the fortress the 
governor, surrounded by a very excited crowd, was dealt blows 
from every direction. It was proposed to hang him, to cut off 
his head, to tie him to a horse's tail. While struggling, he 
accidently kicked one of those present. Some one proposed, and 
his suggestion was at once received with acclamation by the 
crowd, that the individual who had been kicked should cut the 
governor's throat. 
""The individual in question, a cook out of work, whose chief 
reason for being at the Bastille was idle curiosity as to what 
was going on, esteems, that since such is the general opinion, 
the action is patriotic and even believes he deserves a medal for 
having destroyed a monster. With a sword that is lent him he 
strikes the bared neck, but the weapon being somewhat blunt and 
not cutting, he takes from his pocket a small black-handled knife 
and (in his capacity of cook he would be experienced in cutting 
up meat) successfully effects the operation."" 
The working of the process indicated above is clearly seen in 
this example. We have obedience to a suggestion, which is all 
the stronger because of its collective origin, and the murderer's 
conviction that he has committed a very meritorious act, a 
conviction the more natural seeing that he enjoys the unanimous 
approval of his fellow-citizens. An act of this kind may be 
considered crime legally but not psychologically. 
The general characteristics of criminal crowds are precisely the 
same as those we have met with in all crowds: openness to 
suggestion, credulity, mobility, the exaggeration of the 
sentiments good or bad, the manifestation of certain forms of 
morality, &amp;c. 
We shall find all these characteristics present in a crowd which 
has left behind it in French history the most sinister 
memories--the crowd which perpetrated the September massacres. 
In point of fact it offers much similarity with the crowd that 
committed the Saint Bartholomew massacres. I borrow the details 
from the narration of M. Taine, who took them from contemporary 
sources. 
It is not known exactly who gave the order or made the suggestion 
to empty the prisons by massacring the prisoners. Whether it was 
Danton, as is probable, or another does not matter; the one 
interesting fact for us is the powerful suggestion received by 
the crowd charged with the massacre. 
The crowd of murderers numbered some three hundred persons, and 
was a perfectly typical heterogeneous crowd. With the exception 
of a very small number of professional scoundrels, it was 
composed in the main of shopkeepers and artisans of every trade: 
bootmakers, locksmiths, hairdressers, masons, clerks, messengers, 
&amp;c. Under the influence of the suggestion received they are 
perfectly convinced, as was the cook referred to above, that they 
are accomplishing a patriotic duty. They fill a double office, 
being at once judge and executioner, but they do not for a moment 
regard themselves as criminals. 
Deeply conscious of the importance of their duty, they begin by 
forming a sort of tribunal, and in connection with this act the 
ingenuousness of crowds and their rudimentary conception of 
justice are seen immediately. In consideration of the large 
number of the accused, it is decided that, to begin with, the 
nobles, priests, officers, and members of the king's 
household--in a word, all the individuals whose mere profession 
is proof of their guilt in the eyes of a good patriot--shall be 
slaughtered in a body, there being no need for a special decision 
in their case. The remainder shall be judged on their personal 
appearance and their reputation. In this way the rudimentary 
conscience of the crowd is satisfied. It will now be able to 
proceed legally with the massacre, and to give free scope to 
those instincts of ferocity whose genesis I have set forth 
elsewhere, they being instincts which collectivities always have 
it in them to develop to a high degree. These instincts, 
however--as is regularly the case in crowds--will not prevent the 
manifestation of other and contrary sentiments, such as a 
tenderheartedness often as extreme as the ferocity. 
""They have the expansive sympathy and prompt sensibility of the 
Parisian working man. At the Abbaye, one of the federates, 
learning that the prisoners had been left without water for 
twenty-six hours, was bent on putting the gaoler to death, and 
would have done so but for the prayers of the prisoners 
themselves. When a prisoner is acquitted (by the improvised 
tribunal) every one, guards and slaughterers included, embraces 
him with transports of joy and applauds frantically,"" after which 
the wholesale massacre is recommenced. During its progress a 
pleasant gaiety never ceases to reign. There is dancing and 
singing around the corpses, and benches are arranged ""for the 
ladies,"" delighted to witness the killing of aristocrats. The 
exhibition continues, moreover, of a special description of 
justice. 
A slaughterer at the Abbaye having complained that the ladies 
placed at a little distance saw badly, and that only a few of 
those present had the pleasure of striking the aristocrats, the 
justice of the observation is admitted, and it is decided that 
the victims shall be made to pass slowly between two rows of 
slaughterers, who shall be under the obligation to strike with 
the back of the sword only so as to prolong the agony. At the 
prison de la Force the victims are stripped stark naked and 
literally ""carved"" for half an hour, after which, when every one 
has had a good view, they are finished off by a blow that lays 
bare their entrails. 
The slaughterers, too, have their scruples and exhibit that moral 
sense whose existence in crowds we have already pointed out. 
They refuse to appropriate the money and jewels of the victims, 
taking them to the table of the committees. 
Those rudimentary forms of reasoning, characteristic of the mind 
of crowds, are always to be traced in all their acts. Thus, 
after the slaughter of the 1,200 or 1,500 enemies of the nation, 
some one makes the remark, and his suggestion is at once adopted, 
that the other prisons, those containing aged beggars, vagabonds, 
and young prisoners, hold in reality useless mouths, of which it 
would be well on that account to get rid. Besides, among them 
there should certainly be enemies of the people, a woman of the 
name of Delarue, for instance, the widow of a poisoner: ""She 
must be furious at being in prison, if she could she would set 
fire to Paris: she must have said so, she has said so. Another 
good riddance.""  The demonstration appears convincing, and the 
prisoners are massacred without exception, included in the number 
being some fifty children of from twelve to seventeen years of 
age, who, of course, might themselves have become enemies of the 
nation, and of whom in consequence it was clearly well to be rid. 
At the end of a week's work, all these operations being brought 
to an end, the slaughterers can think of reposing themselves. 
Profoundly convinced that they have deserved well of their 
country, they went to the authorities and demanded a recompense. 
The most zealous went so far as to claim a medal. 
The history of the Commune of 1871 affords several facts 
analogous to those which precede. Given the growing influence of 
crowds and the successive capitulations before them of those in 
authority, we are destined to witness many others of a like 
nature. 
CHAPTER III 
CRIMINAL JURIES 
Criminal juries--General characteristics of juries--statistics 
show that their decisions are independent of their 
composition--The manner in which an impression may be made on 
juries--The style and influence of argument--The methods of 
persuasion of celebrated counsel--The nature of those crimes for 
which juries are respectively indulgent or severe--The utility of 
the jury as an institution, and the danger that would result from 
its place being taken by magistrates. 
Being unable to study here every category of jury, I shall only 
examine the most important--that of the juries of the Court of 
Assize. These juries afford an excellent example of the 
heterogeneous crowd that is not anonymous. We shall find them 
display suggestibility and but slight capacity for reasoning, 
while they are open to the influence of the leaders of crowds, 
and they are guided in the main by unconscious sentiments. In 
the course of this investigation we shall have occasion to 
observe some interesting examples of the errors that may be made 
by persons not versed in the psychology of crowds. 
Juries, in the first place, furnish us a good example of the 
slight importance of the mental level of the different elements 
composing a crowd, so far as the decisions it comes to are 
concerned. We have seen that when a deliberative assembly is 
called upon to give its opinion on a question of a character not 
entirely technical, intelligence stands for nothing. For 
instance, a gathering of scientific men or of artists, owing to 
the mere fact that they form an assemblage, will not deliver 
judgments on general subjects sensibly different from those 
rendered by a gathering of masons or grocers. At various 
periods, and in particular previous to 1848, the French 
administration instituted a careful choice among the persons 
summoned to form a jury, picking the jurors from among the 
enlightened classes; choosing professors, functionaries, men of 
letters, &amp;c. At the present day jurors are recruited for the 
most part from among small tradesmen, petty capitalists, and 
employes. Yet, to the great astonishment of specialist writers, 
whatever the composition of the jury has been, its decisions have 
been identical. Even the magistrates, hostile as they are to the 
institution of the jury, have had to recognise the exactness of 
the assertion. M. Berard des Glajeux, a former President of the 
Court of Assizes, expresses himself on the subject in his 
""Memoirs"" in the following terms:-- 
""The selection of jurymen is to-day in reality in the hands of 
the municipal councillors, who put people down on the list or 
eliminate them from it in accordance with the political and 
electoral preoccupations inherent in their situation. . . . The 
majority of the jurors chosen are persons engaged in trade, but 
persons of less importance than formerly, and employes belonging 
to certain branches of the administration. . . . Both opinions 
and professions counting for nothing once the role of judge 
assumed, many of the jurymen having the ardour of neophytes, and 
men of the best intentions being similarly disposed in humble 
situations, the spirit of the jury has not changed: ITS VERDICTS 
HAVE REMAINED THE SAME."" 
Of the passage just cited the conclusions, which are just, are to 
be borne in mind and not the explanations, which are weak. Too 
much astonishment should not be felt at this weakness, for, as a 
rule, counsel equally with magistrates seem to be ignorant of the 
psychology of crowds and, in consequence, of juries. I find a 
proof of this statement in a fact related by the author just 
quoted. He remarks that Lachaud, one of the most illustrious 
barristers practising in the Court of Assize, made systematic use 
of his right to object to a juror in the case of all individuals 
of intelligence on the list. Yet experience--and experience 
alone--has ended by acquainting us with the utter uselessness of 
these objections. This is proved by the fact that at the present 
day public prosecutors and barristers, at any rate those 
belonging to the Parisian bar, have entirely renounced their 
right to object to a juror; still, as M. des Glajeux remarks, the 
verdicts have not changed, ""they are neither better nor worse."" 
Like all crowds, juries are very strongly impressed by 
sentimental considerations, and very slightly by argument. ""They 
cannot resist the sight,"" writes a barrister, ""of a mother giving 
its child the breast, or of orphans.""  ""It is sufficient that a 
woman should be of agreeable appearance,"" says M. des Glajeux, 
""to win the benevolence of the jury."" 
Without pity for crimes of which it appears possible they might 
themselves be the victims--such crimes, moreover, are the most 
dangerous for society--juries, on the contrary, are very 
indulgent in the case of breaches of the law whose motive is 
passion. They are rarely severe on infanticide by girl-mothers, 
or hard on the young woman who throws vitriol at the man who has 
seduced and deserted her, for the reason that they feel 
instinctively that society runs but slight danger from such 
crimes,[24] and that in a country in which the law does not 
protect deserted girls the crime of the girl who avenges herself 
is rather useful than harmful, inasmuch as it frightens future 
seducers in advance. 
[24] It is to be remarked, in passing, that this division of 
crimes into those dangerous and those not dangerous for society, 
which is well and instinctively made by juries is far from being 
unjust. The object of criminal laws is evidently to protect 
society against dangerous criminals and not to avenge it. On the 
other hand, the French code, and above all the minds of the 
French magistrates, are still deeply imbued with the spirit of 
vengeance characteristic of the old primitive law, and the term 
""vindicte"" (prosecution, from the Latin vindicta, vengeance) is 
still in daily use. A proof of this tendency on the part of the 
magistrates is found in the refusal by many of them to apply 
Berenger's law, which allows of a condemned person not undergoing 
his sentence unless he repeats his crime. Yet no magistrate can 
be ignorant, for the fact is proved by statistics, that the 
application of a punishment inflicted for the first time 
infallibly leads to further crime on the part of the person 
punished. When judges set free a sentenced person it always 
seems to them that society has not been avenged. Rather than not 
avenge it they prefer to create a dangerous, confirmed criminal. 
Juries, like all crowds, are profoundly impressed by prestige, 
and President des Glajeux very properly remarks that, very 
democratic as juries are in their composition, they are very 
aristocratic in their likes and dislikes: ""Name, birth, great 
wealth, celebrity, the assistance of an illustrious counsel, 
everything in the nature of distinction or that lends brilliancy 
to the accused, stands him in extremely good stead."" 
The chief concern of a good counsel should be to work upon the 
feelings of the jury, and, as with all crowds, to argue but 
little, or only to employ rudimentary modes of reasoning. An 
English barrister, famous for his successes in the assize courts, 
has well set forth the line of action to be followed:-- 
""While pleading he would attentively observe the jury. The most 
favourable opportunity has been reached. By dint of insight and 
experience the counsel reads the effect of each phrase on the 
faces of the jurymen, and draws his conclusions in consequence. 
His first step is to be sure which members of the jury are 
already favourable to his cause. It is short work to definitely 
gain their adhesion, and having done so he turns his attention to 
the members who seem, on the contrary, ill-disposed, and 
endeavours to discover why they are hostile to the accused. This 
is the delicate part of his task, for there may be an infinity of 
reasons for condemning a man, apart from the sentiment of 
justice."" 
These few lines resume the entire mechanism of the art of 
oratory, and we see why the speech prepared in advance has so 
slight an effect, it being necessary to be able to modify the 
terms employed from moment to moment in accordance with the 
impression produced. 
The orator does not require to convert to his views all the 
members of a jury, but only the leading spirits among it who will 
determine the general opinion. As in all crowds, so in juries 
there are a small number of individuals who serve as guides to 
the rest. ""I have found by experience,"" says the counsel cited 
above, ""that one or two energetic men suffice to carry the rest 
of the jury with them.""  It is those two or three whom it is 
necessary to convince by skilful suggestions. First of all, and 
above all, it is necessary to please them. The man forming part 
of a crowd whom one has succeeded in pleasing is on the point of 
being convinced, and is quite disposed to accept as excellent any 
arguments that may be offered him. I detach the following 
anecdote from an interesting account of M. Lachaud, alluded to 
above:-- 
""It is well known that during all the speeches he would deliver 
in the course of an assize sessions, Lachaud never lost sight of 
the two or three jurymen whom he knew or felt to be influential 
but obstinate. As a rule he was successful in winning over these 
refractory jurors. On one occasion, however, in the provinces, 
he had to deal with a juryman whom he plied in vain for 
three-quarters of an hour with his most cunning arguments; the 
man was the seventh juryman, the first on the second bench. The 
case was desperate. Suddenly, in the middle of a passionate 
demonstration, Lachaud stopped short, and addressing the 
President of the court said: `Would you give instructions for 
the curtain there in front to be drawn? The seventh juryman is 
blinded by the sun.'  The juryman in question reddened, smiled, 
and expressed his thanks. He was won over for the defence."" 
Many writers, some of them most distinguished, have started of 
late a strong campaign against the institution of the jury, 
although it is the only protection we have against the errors, 
really very frequent, of a caste that is under no control.[25]  A 
portion of these writers advocate a jury recruited solely from 
the ranks of the enlightened classes; but we have already proved 
that even in this case the verdicts would be identical with those 
returned under the present system. Other writers, taking their 
stand on the errors committed by juries, would abolish the jury 
and replace it by judges. It is difficult to see how these 
would-be reformers can forget that the errors for which the jury 
is blamed were committed in the first instance by judges, and 
that when the accused person comes before a jury he has already 
been held to be guilty by several magistrates, by the juge 
d'instruction, the public prosecutor, and the Court of 
Arraignment. It should thus be clear that were the accused to be 
definitely judged by magistrates instead of by jurymen, he would 
lose his only chance of being admitted innocent. The errors of 
juries have always been first of all the errors of magistrates. 
It is solely the magistrates, then, who should be blamed when 
particularly monstrous judicial errors crop up, such, for 
instance, as the quite recent condemnation of Dr. L---- who, 
prosecuted by a juge d'instruction, of excessive stupidity, on 
the strength of the denunciation of a half-idiot girl, who 
accused the doctor of having performed an illegal operation upon 
her for thirty francs, would have been sent to penal servitude 
but for an explosion of public indignation, which had for result 
that he was immediately set at liberty by the Chief of the State. 
The honourable character given the condemned man by all his 
fellow-citizens made the grossness of the blunder self-evident. 
The magistrates themselves admitted it, and yet out of caste 
considerations they did all they could to prevent the pardon 
being signed. In all similar affairs the jury, confronted with 
technical details it is unable to understand, naturally hearkens 
to the public prosecutor, arguing that, after all, the affair has 
been investigated by magistrates trained to unravel the most 
intricate situations. Who, then, are the real authors of the 
error--the jurymen or the magistrates? We should cling 
vigorously to the jury. It constitutes, perhaps, the only 
category of crowd that cannot be replaced by any individuality. 
It alone can temper the severity of the law, which, equal for 
all, ought in principle to be blind and to take no cognisance of 
particular cases. Inaccessible to pity, and heeding nothing but 
the text of the law, the judge in his professional severity would 
visit with the same penalty the burglar guilty of murder and the 
wretched girl whom poverty and her abandonment by her seducer 
have driven to infanticide. The jury, on the other hand, 
instinctively feels that the seduced girl is much less guilty 
than the seducer, who, however, is not touched by the law, and 
that she deserves every indulgence. 
[25] The magistracy is, in point of fact, the only administration 
whose acts are under no control. In spite of all its 
revolutions, democratic France does not possess that right of 
habeas corpus of which England is so proud. We have banished all 
the tyrants, but have set up a magistrate in each city who 
disposes at will of the honour and liberty of the citizens. An 
insignificant juge d'instruction (an examining magistrate who has 
no exact counterpart in England.--Trans.), fresh from the 
university, possesses the revolting power of sending to prison at 
will persons of the most considerable standing, on a simple 
supposition on his part of their guilt, and without being obliged 
to justify his act to any one. Under the pretext of pursuing his 
investigation he can keep these persons in prison for six months 
or even a year, and free them at last without owing them either 
an indemnity or excuses. The warrant in France is the exact 
equivalent of the lettre de cachet, with this difference, that 
the latter, with the use of which the monarchy was so justly 
reproached, could only be resorted to by persons occupying a very 
high position, while the warrant is an instrument in the hands of 
a whole class of citizens which is far from passing for being 
very enlightened or very independent. 
Being well acquainted with the psychology of castes, and also 
with the psychology of other categories of crowds, I do not 
perceive a single case in which, wrongly accused of a crime, I 
should not prefer to have to deal with a jury rather than with 
magistrates. I should have some chance that my innocence would 
be recognised by the former and not the slightest chance that it 
would be admitted by the latter. The power of crowds is to be 
dreaded, but the power of certain castes is to be dreaded yet 
more. Crowds are open to conviction; castes never are. 
CHAPTER IV 
ELECTORAL CROWDS 
General characteristics of electoral crowds--The manner of 
persuading them--The qualities that should be possessed by a 
candidate--Necessity of prestige--Why working men and peasants so 
rarely choose candidates from their own class--The influence of 
words and formulas on the elector--The general aspect of election 
oratory--How the opinions of the elector are formed--The power of 
political committees--They represent the most redoubtable form of 
tyranny--The committees of the Revolution-- Universal suffrage 
cannot be replaced in spite of its slight psychological 
value--Why it is that the votes recorded would remain the same 
even if the right of voting were restricted to a limited class of 
citizens--What universal suffrage expresses in all countries. 
ELECTORAL crowds--that is to say, collectivities invested with 
the power of electing the holders of certain 
functions--constitute heterogeneous crowds, but as their action 
is confined to a single clearly determined matter, namely, to 
choosing between different candidates, they present only a few of 
the characteristics previously described. Of the characteristics 
peculiar to crowds, they display in particular but slight 
aptitude for reasoning, the absence of the critical spirit, 
irritability, credulity, and simplicity. In their decision, 
moreover, is to be traced the influence of the leaders of crowds 
and the part played by the factors we have enumerated: 
affirmation, repetition, prestige, and contagion. 
Let us examine by what methods electoral crowds are to be 
persuaded. It will be easy to deduce their psychology from the 
methods that are most successful. 
It is of primary importance that the candidate should possess 
prestige. Personal prestige can only be replaced by that 
resulting from wealth. Talent and even genius are not elements 
of success of serious importance. 
Of capital importance, on the other hand, is the necessity for 
the candidate of possessing prestige, of being able, that is, to 
force himself upon the electorate without discussion. The reason 
why the electors, of whom a majority are working men or peasants, 
so rarely choose a man from their own ranks to represent them is 
that such a person enjoys no prestige among them. When, by 
chance, they do elect a man who is their equal, it is as a rule 
for subsidiary reasons--for instance, to spite an eminent man, or 
an influential employer of labour on whom the elector is in daily 
dependence, and whose master he has the illusion he becomes in 
this way for a moment. 
The possession of prestige does not suffice, however, to assure 
the success of a candidate. The elector stickles in particular 
for the flattery of his greed and vanity. He must be overwhelmed 
with the most extravagant blandishments, and there must be no 
hesitation in making him the most fantastic promises. If he is a 
working man it is impossible to go too far in insulting and 
stigmatising employers of labour. As for the rival candidate, an 
effort must be made to destroy his chance by establishing by dint 
of affirmation, repetition, and contagion that he is an arrant 
scoundrel, and that it is a matter of common knowledge that he 
has been guilty of several crimes. It is, of course, useless to 
trouble about any semblance of proof. Should the adversary be 
ill-acquainted with the psychology of crowds he will try to 
justify himself by arguments instead of confining himself to 
replying to one set of affirmations by another; and he will have 
no chance whatever of being successful. 
The candidate's written programme should not be too categorical, 
since later on his adversaries might bring it up against him; in 
his verbal programme, however, there cannot be too much 
exaggeration. The most important reforms may be fearlessly 
promised. At the moment they are made these exaggerations 
produce a great effect, and they are not binding for the future, 
it being a matter of constant observation that the elector never 
troubles himself to know how far the candidate he has returned 
has followed out the electoral programme he applauded, and in 
virtue of which the election was supposed to have been secured. 
In what precedes, all the factors of persuasion which we have 
described are to be recognised. We shall come across them again 
in the action exerted by words and formulas, whose magical sway 
we have already insisted upon. An orator who knows how to make 
use of these means of persuasion can do what he will with a 
crowd. Expressions such as infamous capital, vile exploiters, 
the admirable working man, the socialisation of wealth, &amp;c., 
always produce the same effect, although already somewhat worn by 
use. But the candidate who hits on a new formula as devoid as 
possible of precise meaning, and apt in consequence to flatter 
the most varied aspirations, infallibly obtains a success. The 
sanguinary Spanish revolution of 1873 was brought about by one of 
these magical phrases of complex meaning on which everybody can 
put his own interpretation. A contemporary writer has described 
the launching of this phrase in terms that deserve to be 
quoted:-- 
""The radicals have made the discovery that a centralised republic 
is a monarchy in disguise, and to humour them the Cortes had 
unanimously proclaimed a FEDERAL REPUBLIC, though none of the 
voters could have explained what it was he had just voted for. 
This formula, however, delighted everybody; the joy was 
intoxicating, delirious. The reign of virtue and happiness had 
just been inaugurated on earth. A republican whose opponent 
refused him the title of federalist considered himself to be 
mortally insulted. People addressed each other in the streets 
with the words: `Long live the federal republic!'  After which 
the praises were sung of the mystic virtue of the absence of 
discipline in the army, and of the autonomy of the soldiers. 
What was understood by the `federal republic?'  There were those 
who took it to mean the emancipation of the provinces, 
institutions akin to those of the United States and 
administrative decentralisation; others had in view the abolition 
of all authority and the speedy commencement of the great social 
liquidation. The socialists of Barcelona and Andalusia stood out 
for the absolute sovereignty of the communes; they proposed to 
endow Spain with ten thousand independent municipalities, to 
legislate on their own account, and their creation to be 
accompanied by the suppression of the police and the army. In 
the southern provinces the insurrection was soon seen to spread 
from town to town and village to village. Directly a village had 
made its pronunciamento its first care was to destroy the 
telegraph wires and the railway lines so as to cut off all 
communication with its neighbours and Madrid. The sorriest 
hamlet was determined to stand on its own bottom. Federation had 
given place to cantonalism, marked by massacres, incendiarism, 
and every description of brutality, and bloody saturnalia were 
celebrated throughout the length and breadth of the land."" 
With respect to the influence that may be exerted by reasoning on 
the minds of electors, to harbour the least doubt on this subject 
can only be the result of never having read the reports of an 
electioneering meeting. In such a gathering affirmations, 
invectives, and sometimes blows are exchanged, but never 
arguments. Should silence be established for a moment it is 
because some one present, having the reputation of a ""tough 
customer,"" has announced that he is about to heckle the candidate 
by putting him one of those embarrassing questions which are 
always the joy of the audience. The satisfaction, however, of 
the opposition party is shortlived, for the voice of the 
questioner is soon drowned in the uproar made by his adversaries. 
The following reports of public meetings, chosen from hundreds of 
similar examples, and taken from the daily papers, may be 
considered as typical:-- 
""One of the organisers of the meeting having asked the assembly 
to elect a president, the storm bursts. The anarchists leap on 
to the platform to take the committee table by storm. The 
socialists make an energetic defence; blows are exchanged, and 
each party accuses the other of being spies in the pay of the 
Government, &amp;c. . . . A citizen leaves the hall with a black 
eye. 
""The committee is at length installed as best it may be in the 
midst of the tumult, and the right to speak devolves upon 
`Comrade' X. 
""The orator starts a vigorous attack on the socialists, who 
interrupt him with shouts of `Idiot, scoundrel, blackguard!' &amp;c., 
epithets to which Comrade X. replies by setting forth a theory 
according to which the socialists are `idiots' or `jokers.'"" 
""The Allemanist party had organised yesterday evening, in the 
Hall of Commerce, in the Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, a great 
meeting, preliminary to the workers' fete of the 1st of May. The 
watchword of the meeting was `Calm and Tranquillity!' 
""Comrade G---- alludes to the socialists as `idiots' and 
`humbugs.' 
""At these words there is an exchange of invectives and orators 
and audience come to blows. Chairs, tables, and benches are 
converted into weapons,"" &amp;c., &amp;c. 
It is not to be imagined for a moment that this description of 
discussion is peculiar to a determined class of electors and 
dependent on their social position. In every anonymous assembly 
whatever, though it be composed exclusively of highly educated 
persons, discussion always assumes the same shape. I have shown 
that when men are collected in a crowd there is a tendency 
towards their mental levelling at work, and proof of this is to 
be found at every turn. Take, for example, the following extract 
from a report of a meeting composed exclusively of students, 
which I borrow from the Temps of 13th of February, 1895:-- 
""The tumult only increased as the evening went on; I do not 
believe that a single orator succeeded in uttering two sentences 
without being interrupted. At every instant there came shouts 
from this or that direction or from every direction at once. 
Applause was intermingled with hissing, violent discussions were 
in progress between individual members of the audience, sticks 
were brandished threateningly, others beat a tattoo on the floor, 
and the interrupters were greeted with yells of `Put him out!' or 
`Let him speak!' 
""M. C---- lavished such epithets as odious and cowardly, 
monstrous, vile, venal and vindictive, on the Association, which 
he declared he wanted to destroy,"" &amp;c., &amp;c. 
How, it may be asked, can an elector form an opinion under such 
conditions? To put such a question is to harbour a strange 
delusion as to the measure of liberty that may be enjoyed by a 
collectivity. Crowds have opinions that have been imposed upon 
them, but they never boast reasoned opinions. In the case under 
consideration the opinions and votes of the electors are in the 
hands of the election committees, whose leading spirits are, as a 
rule, publicans, their influence over the working men, to whom 
they allow credit, being great. ""Do you know what an election 
committee is?"" writes M. Scherer, one of the most valiant 
champions of present-day democracy. ""It is neither more nor less 
than the corner-stone of our institutions, the masterpiece of the 
political machine. France is governed to-day by the election 
committees.""[26] 
[26] Committees under whatever name, clubs, syndicates, &amp;c., 
constitute perhaps the most redoubtable danger resulting from the 
power of crowds. They represent in reality the most impersonal 
and, in consequence, the most oppressive form of tyranny. The 
leaders who direct the committees being supposed to speak and act 
in the name of a collectivity, are freed from all responsibility, 
and are in a position to do just as they choose. The most savage 
tyrant has never ventured even to dream of such proscriptions as 
those ordained by the committees of the Revolution. Barras has 
declared that they decimated the convention, picking off its 
members at their pleasure. So long as he was able to speak in 
their name, Robespierre wielded absolute power. The moment this 
frightful dictator separated himself from them, for reasons of 
personal pride, he was lost. The reign of crowds is the reign of 
committees, that is, of the leaders of crowds. A severer 
despotism cannot be imagined. 
To exert an influence over them is not difficult, provided the 
candidate be in himself acceptable and possess adequate financial 
resources. According to the admissions of the donors, three 
millions of francs sufficed to secure the repeated elections of 
General Boulanger. 
Such is the psychology of electoral crowds. It is identical with 
that of other crowds: neither better nor worse. 
In consequence I draw no conclusion against universal suffrage 
from what precedes. Had I to settle its fate, I should preserve 
it as it is for practical reasons, which are to be deduced in 
point of fact from our investigation of the psychology of crowds. 
On this account I shall proceed to set them forth. 
No doubt the weak side of universal suffrage is too obvious to be 
overlooked. It cannot be gainsaid that civilisation has been the 
work of a small minority of superior intelligences constituting 
the culminating point of a pyramid, whose stages, widening in 
proportion to the decrease of mental power, represent the masses 
of a nation. The greatness of a civilisation cannot assuredly 
depend upon the votes given by inferior elements boasting solely 
numerical strength. Doubtless, too, the votes recorded by crowds 
are often very dangerous. They have already cost us several 
invasions, and in view of the triumph of socialism, for which 
they are preparing the way, it is probable that the vagaries of 
popular sovereignty will cost us still more dearly. 
Excellent, however, as these objections are in theory, in 
practice they lose all force, as will be admitted if the 
invincible strength be remembered of ideas transformed into 
dogmas. The dogma of the sovereignty of crowds is as little 
defensible, from the philosophical point of view, as the 
religious dogmas of the Middle Ages, but it enjoys at present the 
same absolute power they formerly enjoyed. It is as unattackable 
in consequence as in the past were our religious ideas. Imagine 
a modern freethinker miraculously transported into the midst of 
the Middle Ages. Do you suppose that, after having ascertained 
the sovereign power of the religious ideas that were then in 
force, he would have been tempted to attack them? Having fallen 
into the hands of a judge disposed to send him to the stake, 
under the imputation of having concluded a pact with the devil, 
or of having been present at the witches sabbath, would it have 
occurred to him to call in question the existence of the devil or 
of the sabbath? It were as wise to oppose cyclones with 
discussion as the beliefs of crowds. The dogma of universal 
suffrage possesses to-day the power the Christian dogmas formerly 
possessed. Orators and writers allude to it with a respect and 
adulation that never fell to the share of Louis XIV. In 
consequence the same position must be taken up with regard to it 
as with regard to all religious dogmas. Time alone can act upon 
them. 
Besides, it would be the more useless to attempt to undermine 
this dogma, inasmuch as it has an appearance of reasonableness in 
its favour. ""In an era of equality,"" Tocqueville justly remarks, 
""men have no faith in each other on account of their being all 
alike; yet this same similitude gives them an almost limitless 
confidence in the judgment of the public, the reason being that 
it does not appear probable that, all men being equally 
enlightened, truth and numerical superiority should not go hand 
in hand."" 
Must it be believed that with a restricted suffrage--a suffrage 
restricted to those intellectually capable if it be desired--an 
improvement would be effected in the votes of crowds? I cannot 
admit for a moment that this would be the case, and that for the 
reasons I have already given touching the mental inferiority of 
all collectivities, whatever their composition. In a crowd men 
always tend to the same level, and, on general questions, a vote, 
recorded by forty academicians is no better than that of forty 
water-carriers. I do not in the least believe that any of the 
votes for which universal suffrage is blamed--the 
re-establishment of the Empire, for instance-- would have fallen 
out differently had the voters been exclusively recruited among 
learned and liberally educated men. It does not follow because 
an individual knows Greek or mathematics, is an architect, a 
veterinary surgeon, a doctor, or a barrister, that he is endowed 
with a special intelligence of social questions. All our 
political economists are highly educated, being for the most part 
professors or academicians, yet is there a single general 
question--protection, bimetallism, &amp;c.--on which they have 
succeeded in agreeing? The explanation is that their science is 
only a very attenuated form of our universal ignorance. With 
regard to social problems, owing to the number of unknown 
quantities they offer, men are substantially, equally ignorant. 
In consequence, were the electorate solely composed of persons 
stuffed with sciences their votes would be no better than those 
emitted at present. They would be guided in the main by their 
sentiments and by party spirit. We should be spared none of the 
difficulties we now have to contend with, and we should certainly 
be subjected to the oppressive tyranny of castes. 
Whether the suffrage of crowds be restricted or general, whether 
it be exercised under a republic or a monarchy, in France, in 
Belgium, in Greece, in Portugal, or in Spain, it is everywhere 
identical; and, when all is said and done, it is the expression 
of the unconscious aspirations and needs of the race. In each 
country the average opinions of those elected represent the 
genius of the race, and they will be found not to alter sensibly 
from one generation to another. 
It is seen, then, that we are confronted once more by the 
fundamental notion of race, which we have come across so often, 
and on this other notion, which is the outcome of the first, that 
institutions and governments play but a small part in the life of 
a people. Peoples are guided in the main by the genius of their 
race, that is, by that inherited residue of qualities of which 
the genius is the sum total. Race and the slavery of our daily 
necessities are the mysterious master-causes that rule our 
destiny. 
CHAPTER V 
PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLIES 
Parliamentary crowds present most of the characteristics common 
to heterogeneous crowds that are not anonymous--The simplicity of 
their opinions--Their suggestibility and its limits--Their 
indestructible, fixed opinions and their changed opinions--The 
reason of the predominance of indecision--The role of the 
leaders--The reason of their prestige--They are the true masters 
of an assembly whose votes, on that account, are merely those of 
a small minority--The absolute power they exercise--The elements 
of their oratorical art--Phrases and images--The psychological 
necessity the leaders are under of being in a general way of 
stubborn convictions and narrow-minded--It is impossible for a 
speaker without prestige to obtain recognition for his 
arguments-- The exaggeration of the sentiments, whether good or 
bad, of assemblies-- At certain moments they become 
automatic--The sittings of the Convention--Cases in which an 
assembly loses the characteristics of crowds--The influence of 
specialists when technical questions arise--The advantages and 
dangers of a parliamentary system in all countries--It is adapted 
to modern needs; but it involves financial waste and the 
progressive curtailment of all liberty--Conclusion. 
In parliamentary assemblies we have an example of heterogeneous 
crowds that are not anonymous. Although the mode of election of 
their members varies from epoch to epoch, and from nation to 
nation, they present very similar characteristics. In this case 
the influence of the race makes itself felt to weaken or 
exaggerate the characteristics common to crowds, but not to 
prevent their manifestation. The parliamentary assemblies of the 
most widely different countries, of Greece, Italy, Portugal, 
Spain, France, and America present great analogies in their 
debates and votes, and leave the respective governments face to 
face with identical difficulties. 
Moreover, the parliamentary system represents the ideal of all 
modern civilised peoples. The system is the expression of the 
idea, psychologically erroneous, but generally admitted, that a 
large gathering of men is much more capable than a small number 
of coming to a wise and independent decision on a given subject. 
The general characteristics of crowds are to be met with in 
parliamentary assemblies: intellectual simplicity, irritability, 
suggestibility, the exaggeration of the sentiments and the 
preponderating influence of a few leaders. In consequence, 
however, of their special composition parliamentary crowds offer 
some distinctive features, which we shall point out shortly. 
Simplicity in their opinions is one of their most important 
characteristics. In the case of all parties, and more especially 
so far as the Latin peoples are concerned, an invariable tendency 
is met with in crowds of this kind to solve the most complicated 
social problems by the simplest abstract principles and general 
laws applicable to all cases. Naturally the principles vary with 
the party; but owing to the mere fact that the individual members 
are a part of a crowd, they are always inclined to exaggerate the 
worth of their principles, and to push them to their extreme 
consequences. In consequence parliaments are more especially 
representative of extreme opinions. 
The most perfect example of the ingenuous simplification of 
opinions peculiar to assemblies is offered by the Jacobins of the 
French Revolution. Dogmatic and logical to a man, and their 
brains full of vague generalities, they busied themselves with 
the application of fixed-principles without concerning themselves 
with events. It has been said of them, with reason, that they 
went through the Revolution without witnessing it. With the aid 
of the very simple dogmas that served them as guide, they 
imagined they could recast society from top to bottom, and cause 
a highly refined civilisation to return to a very anterior phase 
of the social evolution. The methods they resorted to to realise 
their dream wore the same stamp of absolute ingenuousness. They 
confined themselves, in reality, to destroying what stood in 
their way. All of them, moreover--Girondists, the Men of the 
Mountain, the Thermidorians, &amp;c.--were alike animated by the same 
spirit. 
Parliamentary crowds are very open to suggestion; and, as in the 
case of all crowds, the suggestion comes from leaders possessing 
prestige; but the suggestibility of parliamentary assemblies has 
very clearly defined limits, which it is important to point out. 
On all questions of local or regional interest every member of an 
assembly has fixed, unalterable opinions, which no amount of 
argument can shake. The talent of a Demosthenes would be 
powerless to change the vote of a Deputy on such questions as 
protection or the privilege of distilling alcohol, questions in 
which the interests of influential electors are involved. The 
suggestion emanating from these electors and undergone before the 
time to vote arrives, sufficiently outweighs suggestions from any 
other source to annul them and to maintain an absolute fixity of 
opinion.[27] 
[27] The following reflection of an English parliamentarian of 
long experience doubtless applies to these opinions, fixed 
beforehand, and rendered unalterable by electioneering 
necessities: ""During the fifty years that I have sat at 
Westminster, I have listened to thousands of speeches; but few of 
them have changed my opinion, not one of them has changed my 
vote."" 
On general questions--the overthrow of a Cabinet, the imposition 
of a tax, &amp;c.--there is no longer any fixity of opinion, and the 
suggestions of leaders can exert an influence, though not in 
quite the same way as in an ordinary crowd. Every party has its 
leaders, who possess occasionally an equal influence. The result 
is that the Deputy finds himself placed between two contrary 
suggestions, and is inevitably made to hesitate. This explains 
how it is that he is often seen to vote in contrary fashion in an 
interval of a quarter of an hour or to add to a law an article 
which nullifies it; for instance, to withdraw from employers of 
labour the right of choosing and dismissing their workmen, and 
then to very nearly annul this measure by an amendment. 
It is for the same reason that every Chamber that is returned has 
some very stable opinions, and other opinions that are very 
shifting. On the whole, the general questions being the more 
numerous, indecision is predominant in the Chamber--the 
indecision which results from the ever- present fear of the 
elector, the suggestion received from whom is always latent, and 
tends to counterbalance the influence of the leaders. 
Still, it is the leaders who are definitely the masters in those 
numerous discussions, with regard to the subject-matter of which 
the members of an assembly are without strong preconceived 
opinions. 
The necessity for these leaders is evident, since, under the name 
of heads of groups, they are met with in the assemblies of every 
country. They are the real rulers of an assembly. Men forming a 
crowd cannot do without a master, whence it results that the 
votes of an assembly only represent, as a rule, the opinions of a 
small minority. 
The influence of the leaders is due in very small measure to the 
arguments they employ, but in a large degree to their prestige. 
The best proof of this is that, should they by any circumstance 
lose their prestige, their influence disappears. 
The prestige of these political leaders is individual, and 
independent of name or celebrity: a fact of which M. Jules Simon 
gives us some very curious examples in his remarks on the 
prominent men of the Assembly of 1848, of which he was a 
member:-- 
""Two months before he was all-powerful, Louis Napoleon was 
entirely without the least importance. 
""Victor Hugo mounted the tribune. He failed to achieve success. 
He was listened to as Felix Pyat was listened to, but he did not 
obtain as much applause. `I don't like his ideas,' Vaulabelle 
said to me, speaking of Felix Pyat,' but he is one of the 
greatest writers and the greatest orator of France.'  Edgar 
Quinet, in spite of his exceptional and powerful intelligence, 
was held in no esteem whatever. He had been popular for awhile 
before the opening of the Assembly; in the Assembly he had no 
popularity. 
""The splendour of genius makes itself less felt in political 
assemblies than anywhere else. They only give heed to eloquence 
appropriate to the time and place and to party services, not to 
services rendered the country. For homage to be rendered 
Lamartine in 1848 and Thiers in 1871, the stimulant was needed of 
urgent, inexorable interest. As soon as the danger was passed 
the parliamentary world forgot in the same instant its gratitude 
and its fright."" 
I have quoted the preceding passage for the sake of the facts it 
contains, not of the explanations it offers, their psychology 
being somewhat poor. A crowd would at once lose its character of 
a crowd were it to credit its leaders with their services, 
whether of a party nature or rendered their country. The crowd 
that obeys a leader is under the influence of his prestige, and 
its submission is not dictated by any sentiment of interest or 
gratitude. 
In consequence the leader endowed with sufficient prestige wields 
almost absolute power. The immense influence exerted during a 
long series of years, thanks to his prestige, by a celebrated 
Deputy,[28] beaten at the last general election in consequence of 
certain financial events, is well known. He had only to give the 
signal and Cabinets were overthrown. A writer has clearly 
indicated the scope of his action in the following lines:-- 
[28] M. Clemenceau.--Note of the Translator. 
""It is due, in the main, to M. X---- that we paid three times as 
dearly as we should have done for Tonkin, that we remained so 
long on a precarious footing in Madagascar, that we were 
defrauded of an empire in the region of the Lower Niger, and that 
we have lost the preponderating situation we used to occupy in 
Egypt. The theories of M. X---- have cost us more territories 
than the disasters of Napoleon I."" 
We must not harbour too bitter a grudge against the leader in 
question. It is plain that he has cost us very dear; but a great 
part of his influence was due to the fact that he followed public 
opinion, which, in colonial matters, was far from being at the 
time what it has since become. A leader is seldom in advance of 
public opinion; almost always all he does is to follow it and to 
espouse all its errors. 
The means of persuasion of the leaders we are dealing with, apart 
from their prestige, consist in the factors we have already 
enumerated several times. To make a skilful use of these 
resources a leader must have arrived at a comprehension, at least 
in an unconscious manner, of the psychology of crowds, and must 
know how to address them. He should be aware, in particular, of 
the fascinating influence of words, phrases, and images. He 
should possess a special description of eloquence, composed of 
energetic affirmations--unburdened with proofs-- and impressive 
images, accompanied by very summary arguments. This is a kind of 
eloquence that is met with in all assemblies, the English 
Parliament included, the most serious though it is of all. 
""Debates in the House of Commons,"" says the English philosopher 
Maine, ""may be constantly read in which the entire discussion is 
confined to an exchange of rather weak generalities and rather 
violent personalities. General formulas of this description 
exercise a prodigious influence on the imagination of a pure 
democracy. It will always be easy to make a crowd accept general 
assertions, presented in striking terms, although they have never 
been verified, and are perhaps not susceptible of verification."" 
Too much importance cannot be attached to the ""striking terms"" 
alluded to in the above quotation. We have already insisted, on 
several occasions, on the special power of words and formulas. 
They must be chosen in such a way as to evoke very vivid images. 
The following phrase, taken from a speech by one of the leaders 
of our assemblies, affords an excellent example:-- 
""When the same vessel shall bear away to the fever-haunted lands 
of our penitentiary settlements the politician of shady 
reputation and the anarchist guilty of murder, the pair will be 
able to converse together, and they will appear to each other as 
the two complementary aspects of one and the same state of 
society."" 
The image thus evoked is very vivid, and all the adversaries of 
the speaker felt themselves threatened by it. They conjured up a 
double vision of the fever-haunted country and the vessel that 
may carry them away; for is it not possible that they are 
included in the somewhat ill-defined category of the politicians 
menaced? They experienced the lurking fear that the men of the 
Convention must have felt whom the vague speeches of Robespierre 
threatened with the guillotine, and who, under the influence of 
this fear, invariably yielded to him. 
It is all to the interest of the leaders to indulge in the most 
improbable exaggerations. The speaker of whom I have just cited 
a sentence was able to affirm, without arousing violent 
protestations, that bankers and priests had subsidised the 
throwers of bombs, and that the directors of the great financial 
companies deserve the same punishment as anarchists. 
Affirmations of this kind are always effective with crowds. The 
affirmation is never too violent, the declamation never too 
threatening. Nothing intimidates the audience more than this 
sort of eloquence. Those present are afraid that if they protest 
they will be put down as traitors or accomplices. 
As I have said, this peculiar style of eloquence has ever been of 
sovereign effect in all assemblies. In times of crisis its power 
is still further accentuated. The speeches of the great orators 
of the assemblies of the French Revolution are very interesting 
reading from this point of view. At every instant they thought 
themselves obliged to pause in order to denounce crime and exalt 
virtue, after which they would burst forth into imprecations 
against tyrants, and swear to live free men or perish. Those 
present rose to their feet, applauded furiously, and then, 
calmed, took their seats again. 
On occasion, the leader may be intelligent and highly educated, 
but the possession of these qualities does him, as a rule, more 
harm than good. By showing how complex things are, by allowing 
of explanation and promoting comprehension, intelligence always 
renders its owner indulgent, and blunts, in a large measure, that 
intensity and violence of conviction needful for apostles. The 
great leaders of crowds of all ages, and those of the Revolution 
in particular, have been of lamentably narrow intellect; while it 
is precisely those whose intelligence has been the most 
restricted who have exercised the greatest influence. 
The speeches of the most celebrated of them, of Robespierre, 
frequently astound one by their incoherence: by merely reading 
them no plausible explanation is to be found of the great part 
played by the powerful dictator:-- 
""The commonplaces and redundancies of pedagogic eloquence and 
Latin culture at the service of a mind childish rather than 
undistinguished, and limited in its notions of attack and defence 
to the defiant attitude of schoolboys. Not an idea, not a happy 
turn of phrase, or a telling hit: a storm of declamation that 
leaves us bored. After a dose of this unexhilarating reading one 
is attempted to exclaim `Oh!' with the amiable Camille 
Desmoulins."" 
It is terrible at times to think of the power that strong 
conviction combined with extreme narrowness of mind gives a man 
possessing prestige. It is none the less necessary that these 
conditions should be satisfied for a man to ignore obstacles and 
display strength of will in a high measure. Crowds instinctively 
recognise in men of energy and conviction the masters they are 
always in need of. 
In a parliamentary assembly the success of a speech depends 
almost solely on the prestige possessed by the speaker, and not 
at all on the arguments he brings forward. The best proof of 
this is that when for one cause or another a speaker loses his 
prestige, he loses simultaneously all his influence, that is, his 
power of influencing votes at will. 
When an unknown speaker comes forward with a speech containing 
good arguments, but only arguments, the chances are that he will 
only obtain a hearing. A Deputy who is a psychologist of 
insight, M. Desaubes, has recently traced in the following lines 
the portrait of the Deputy who lacks prestige:-- 
""When he takes his place in the tribune he draws a document from 
his portfolio, spreads it out methodically before him, and makes 
a start with assurance. 
""He flatters himself that he will implant in the minds of his 
audience the conviction by which he is himself animated. He has 
weighed and reweighed his arguments; he is well primed with 
figures and proofs; he is certain he will convince his hearers. 
In the face of the evidence he is to adduce all resistance would 
be futile. He begins, confident in the justice of his cause, and 
relying upon the attention of his colleagues, whose only anxiety, 
of course, is to subscribe to the truth. 
""He speaks, and is at once surprised at the restlessness of the 
House, and a little annoyed by the noise that is being made. 
""How is it silence is not kept? Why this general inattention? 
What are those Deputies thinking about who are engaged in 
conversation? What urgent motive has induced this or that Deputy 
to quit his seat? 
""An expression of uneasiness crosses his face; he frowns and 
stops. Encouraged by the President, he begins again, raising his 
voice. He is only listened to all the less. He lends emphasis 
to his words, and gesticulates: the noise around him increases. 
He can no longer hear himself, and again stops; finally, afraid 
that his silence may provoke the dreaded cry, `The Closure!' he 
starts off again. The clamour becomes unbearable."" 
When parliamentary assemblies reach a certain pitch of excitement 
they become identical with ordinary heterogeneous crowds, and 
their sentiments in consequence present the peculiarity of being 
always extreme. They will be seen to commit acts of the greatest 
heroism or the worst excesses. The individual is no longer 
himself, and so entirely is this the case that he will vote 
measures most adverse to his personal interests. 
The history of the French Revolution shows to what an extent 
assemblies are capable of losing their self-consciousness, and of 
obeying suggestions most contrary to their interests. It was an 
enormous sacrifice for the nobility to renounce its privileges, 
yet it did so without hesitation on a famous night during the 
sittings of the Constituant Assembly. By renouncing their 
inviolability the men of the Convention placed themselves under a 
perpetual menace of death and yet they took this step, and were 
not afraid to decimate their own ranks, though perfectly aware 
that the scaffold to which they were sending their colleagues 
to-day might be their own fate to-morrow. The truth is they had 
attained to that completely automatic state which I have 
described elsewhere, and no consideration would hinder them from 
yielding to the suggestions by which they were hypnotised. The 
following passage from the memoirs of one of them, 
Billaud-Varennes, is absolutely typical on this score: ""The 
decisions with which we have been so reproached,"" he says, ""WERE 
NOT DESIRED BY US TWO DAYS, A SINGLE DAY BEFORE THEY WERE TAKEN: 
IT WAS THE CRISIS AND NOTHING ELSE THAT GAVE RISE TO THEM."" 
Nothing can be more accurate. 
The same phenomena of unconsciousness were to be witnessed during 
all the stormy sittings of the Convention. 
""They approved and decreed measures,"" says Taine, ""which they 
held in horror--measures which were not only stupid and foolish, 
but measures that were crimes--the murder of innocent men, the 
murder of their friends. The Left, supported by the Right, 
unanimously and amid loud applause, sent to the scaffold Danton, 
its natural chief, and the great promoter and leader of the 
Revolution. Unanimously and amid the greatest applause the 
Right, supported by the Left, votes the worst decrees of the 
revolutionary government. Unanimously and amid cries of 
admiration and enthusiasm, amid demonstrations of passionate 
sympathy for Collot d'Herbois, Couthon, and Robespierre, the 
Convention by spontaneous and repeated re-elections keeps in 
office the homicidal government which the Plain detests because 
it is homicidal, and the Mountain detests because it is decimated 
by it. The Plain and the Mountain, the majority and the 
minority, finish by consenting to help on their own suicide. The 
22 Prairial the entire Convention offered itself to the 
executioner; the 8 Thermidor, during the first quarter of an hour 
that followed Robespierre's speech, it did the same thing again."" 
This picture may appear sombre. Yet it is accurate. 
Parliamentary assemblies, sufficiently excited and hypnotised, 
offer the same characteristics. They become an unstable flock, 
obedient to every impulsion. The following description of the 
Assembly of 1848 is due to M. Spuller, a parliamentarian whose 
faith in democracy is above suspicion. I reproduce it from the 
Revue litteraire, and it is thoroughly typical. It offers an 
example of all the exaggerated sentiments which I have described 
as characteristic of crowds, and of that excessive changeableness 
which permits of assemblies passing, from moment to moment, from 
one set of sentiments to another entirely opposite. 
""The Republican party was brought to its perdition by its 
divisions, its jealousies, its suspicions, and, in turn, its 
blind confidence and its limitless hopes. Its ingenuousness and 
candour were only equalled by its universal mistrust. An absence 
of all sense of legality, of all comprehension of discipline, 
together with boundless terrors and illusions; the peasant and 
the child are on a level in these respects. Their calm is as 
great as their impatience; their ferocity is equal to their 
docility. This condition is the natural consequence of a 
temperament that is not formed and of the lack of education. 
Nothing astonishes such persons, and everything disconcerts them. 
Trembling with fear or brave to the point of heroism, they would 
go through fire and water or fly from a shadow. 
""They are ignorant of cause and effect and of the connecting 
links between events. They are as promptly discouraged as they 
are exalted, they are subject to every description of panic, they 
are always either too highly strung or too downcast, but never in 
the mood or the measure the situation would require. More fluid 
than water they reflect every line and assume every shape. What 
sort of a foundation for a government can they be expected to 
supply?"" 
Fortunately all the characteristics just described as to be met 
with in parliamentary assemblies are in no wise constantly 
displayed. Such assemblies only constitute crowds at certain 
moments. The individuals composing them retain their 
individuality in a great number of cases, which explains how it 
is that an assembly is able to turn out excellent technical laws. 
It is true that the author of these laws is a specialist who has 
prepared them in the quiet of his study, and that in reality the 
law voted is the work of an individual and not of an assembly. 
These laws are naturally the best. They are only liable to have 
disastrous results when a series of amendments has converted them 
into the outcome of a collective effort. The work of a crowd is 
always inferior, whatever its nature, to that of an isolated 
individual. It is specialists who safeguard assemblies from 
passing ill-advised or unworkable measures. The specialist in 
this case is a temporary leader of crowds. The Assembly is 
without influence on him, but he has influence over the Assembly. 
In spite of all the difficulties attending their working, 
parliamentary assemblies are the best form of government mankind 
has discovered as yet, and more especially the best means it has 
found to escape the yoke of personal tyrannies. They constitute 
assuredly the ideal government at any rate for philosophers, 
thinkers, writers, artists, and learned men--in a word, for all 
those who form the cream of a civilisation. 
Moreover, in reality they only present two serious dangers, one 
being inevitable financial waste, and the other the progressive 
restriction of the liberty of the individual. 
The first of these dangers is the necessary consequence of the 
exigencies and want of foresight of electoral crowds. Should a 
member of an assembly propose a measure giving apparent 
satisfaction to democratic ideas, should he bring in a Bill, for 
instance, to assure old-age pensions to all workers, and to 
increase the wages of any class of State employes, the other 
Deputies, victims of suggestion in their dread of their electors, 
will not venture to seem to disregard the interests of the latter 
by rejecting the proposed measure, although well aware they are 
imposing a fresh strain on the Budget and necessitating the 
creation of new taxes. It is impossible for them to hesitate to 
give their votes. The consequences of the increase of 
expenditure are remote and will not entail disagreeable 
consequences for them personally, while the consequences of a 
negative vote might clearly come to light when they next present 
themselves for re-election. 
In addition to this first cause of an exaggerated expenditure 
there is another not less imperative--the necessity of voting all 
grants for local purposes. A Deputy is unable to oppose grants 
of this kind because they represent once more the exigencies of 
the electors, and because each individual Deputy can only obtain 
what he requires for his own constituency on the condition of 
acceding to similar demands on the part of his colleagues.[29] 
[29] In its issue of April 6, 1895, the Economiste published a 
curious review of the figures that may be reached by expenditure 
caused solely by electoral considerations, and notably of the 
outlay on railways. To put Langayes (a town of 3,000 
inhabitants, situated on a mountain) in communication with Puy, a 
railway is voted that will cost 15 millions of francs. Seven 
millions are to be spent to put Beaumont (3,500 inhabitants) in 
communication with Castel-Sarrazin; 7 millions to put Oust (a 
village of 523 inhabitants) in communication with Seix (1,200 
inhabitants); 6 millions to put Prade in communication with the 
hamlet of Olette (747 inhabitants), &amp;c. In 1895 alone 90 
millions of francs were voted for railways of only local utility. 
There is other no less important expenditure necessitated also by 
electioneering considerations. The law instituting workingmen's 
pensions will soon involve a minimum annual outlay of 165 
millions, according to the Minister of Finance, and of 800 
millions according to the academician M. Leroy-Beaulieu. It is 
evident that the continued growth of expenditure of this kind 
must end in bankruptcy. Many European countries--Portugal, 
Greece, Spain, Turkey--have reached this stage, and others, such 
as Italy, will soon be reduced to the same extremity. Still too 
much alarm need not be felt at this state of things, since the 
public has successively consented to put up with the reduction of 
four-fifths in the payment of their coupons by these different 
countries. Bankruptcy under these ingenious conditions allows 
the equilibrium of Budgets difficult to balance to be instantly 
restored. Moreover, wars, socialism, and economic conflicts hold 
in store for us a profusion of other catastrophes in the period 
of universal disintegration we are traversing, and it is 
necessary to be resigned to living from hand to mouth without too 
much concern for a future we cannot control. 
The second of the dangers referred to above--the inevitable 
restrictions on liberty consummated by parliamentary 
assemblies--is apparently less obvious, but is, nevertheless, 
very real. It is the result of the innumerable laws--having 
always a restrictive action--which parliaments consider 
themselves obliged to vote and to whose consequences, owing to 
their shortsightedness, they are in a great measure blind. 
The danger must indeed be most inevitable, since even England 
itself, which assuredly offers the most popular type of the 
parliamentary regime, the type in which the representative is 
most independent of his elector, has been unable to escape it. 
Herbert Spencer has shown, in a work already old, that the 
increase of apparent liberty must needs be followed by the 
decrease of real liberty. Returning to this contention in his 
recent book, ""The Individual versus the State,"" he thus expresses 
himself with regard to the English Parliament:-- 
""Legislation since this period has followed the course, I pointed 
out. Rapidly multiplying dictatorial measures have continually 
tended to restrict individual liberties, and this in two ways. 
Regulations have been established every year in greater number, 
imposing a constraint on the citizen in matters in which his acts 
were formerly completely free, and forcing him to accomplish acts 
which he was formerly at liberty to accomplish or not to 
accomplish at will. At the same time heavier and heavier public, 
and especially local, burdens have still further restricted his 
liberty by diminishing the portion of his profits he can spend as 
he chooses, and by augmenting the portion which is taken from him 
to be spent according to the good pleasure of the public 
authorities."" 
This progressive restriction of liberties shows itself in every 
country in a special shape which Herbert Spencer has not pointed 
out; it is that the passing of these innumerable series of 
legislative measures, all of them in a general way of a 
restrictive order, conduces necessarily to augment the number, 
the power, and the influence of the functionaries charged with 
their application. These functionaries tend in this way to 
become the veritable masters of civilised countries. Their power 
is all the greater owing to the fact that, amidst the incessant 
transfer of authority, the administrative caste is alone in being 
untouched by these changes, is alone in possessing 
irresponsibility, impersonality, and perpetuity. There is no 
more oppressive despotism than that which presents itself under 
this triple form. 
This incessant creation of restrictive laws and regulations, 
surrounding the pettiest actions of existence with the most 
complicated formalities, inevitably has for its result the 
confining within narrower and narrower limits of the sphere in 
which the citizen may move freely. Victims of the delusion that 
equality and liberty are the better assured by the multiplication 
of laws, nations daily consent to put up with trammels 
increasingly burdensome. They do not accept this legislation 
with impunity. Accustomed to put up with every yoke, they soon 
end by desiring servitude, and lose all spontaneousness and 
energy. They are then no more than vain shadows, passive, 
unresisting and powerless automata. 
Arrived at this point, the individual is bound to seek outside 
himself the forces he no longer finds within him. The functions 
of governments necessarily increase in proportion as the 
indifference and helplessness of the citizens grow. They it is 
who must necessarily exhibit the initiative, enterprising, and 
guiding spirit in which private persons are lacking. It falls on 
them to undertake everything, direct everything, and take 
everything under their protection. The State becomes an 
all-powerful god. Still experience shows that the power of such 
gods was never either very durable or very strong. 
This progressive restriction of all liberties in the case of 
certain peoples, in spite of an outward license that gives them 
the illusion that these liberties are still in their possession, 
seems at least as much a consequence of their old age as of any 
particular system. It constitutes one of the precursory symptoms 
of that decadent phase which up to now no civilisation has 
escaped. 
Judging by the lessons of the past, and by the symptoms that 
strike the attention on every side, several of our modern 
civilisations have reached that phase of extreme old age which 
precedes decadence. It seems inevitable that all peoples should 
pass through identical phases of existence, since history is so 
often seen to repeat its course. 
It is easy to note briefly these common phases of the evolution 
of civilisations, and I shall terminate this work with a summary 
of them. This rapid sketch will perhaps throw some gleams of 
light on the causes of the power at present wielded by crowds. 
If we examine in their main lines the genesis of the greatness 
and of the fall of the civilisations that preceded our own, what 
do we see? 
At the dawn of civilisation a swarm of men of various origin, 
brought together by the chances of migrations, invasions, and 
conquests. Of different blood, and of equally different 
languages and beliefs, the only common bond of union between 
these men is the half-recognised law of a chief. The 
psychological characteristics of crowds are present in an eminent 
degree in these confused agglomerations. They have the transient 
cohesion of crowds, their heroism, their weaknesses, their 
impulsiveness, and their violence. Nothing is stable in 
connection with them. They are barbarians. 
At length time accomplishes its work. The identity of 
surroundings, the repeated intermingling of races, the 
necessities of life in common exert their influence. The 
assemblage of dissimilar units begins to blend into a whole, to 
form a race; that is, an aggregate possessing common 
characteristics and sentiments to which heredity will give 
greater and greater fixity. The crowd has become a people, and 
this people is able to emerge from its barbarous state. However, 
it will only entirely emerge therefrom when, after long efforts, 
struggles necessarily repeated, and innumerable recommencements, 
it shall have acquired an ideal. The nature of this ideal is of 
slight importance; whether it be the cult of Rome, the might of 
Athens, or the triumph of Allah, it will suffice to endow all the 
individuals of the race that is forming with perfect unity of 
sentiment and thought. 
At this stage a new civilisation, with its institutions, its 
beliefs, and its arts, may be born. In pursuit of its ideal, the 
race will acquire in succession the qualities necessary to give 
it splendour, vigour, and grandeur. At times no doubt it will 
still be a crowd, but henceforth, beneath the mobile and changing 
characteristics of crowds, is found a solid substratum, the 
genius of the race which confines within narrow limits the 
transformations of a nation and overrules the play of chance. 
After having exerted its creative action, time begins that work 
of destruction from which neither gods nor men escape. Having 
reached a certain level of strength and complexity a civilisation 
ceases to grow, and having ceased to grow it is condemned to a 
speedy decline. The hour of its old age has struck. 
This inevitable hour is always marked by the weakening of the 
ideal that was the mainstay of the race. In proportion as this 
ideal pales all the religious, political, and social structures 
inspired by it begin to be shaken. 
With the progressive perishing of its ideal the race loses more 
and more the qualities that lent it its cohesion, its unity, and 
its strength. The personality and intelligence of the individual 
may increase, but at the same time this collective egoism of the 
race is replaced by an excessive development of the egoism of the 
individual, accompanied by a weakening of character and a 
lessening of the capacity for action. What constituted a people, 
a unity, a whole, becomes in the end an agglomeration of 
individualities lacking cohesion, and artificially held together 
for a time by its traditions and institutions. It is at this 
stage that men, divided by their interests and aspirations, and 
incapable any longer of self-government, require directing in 
their pettiest acts, and that the State exerts an absorbing 
influence. 
With the definite loss of its old ideal the genius of the race 
entirely disappears; it is a mere swarm of isolated individuals 
and returns to its original state--that of a crowd. Without 
consistency and without a future, it has all the transitory 
characteristics of crowds. Its civilisation is now without 
stability, and at the mercy of every chance. The populace is 
sovereign, and the tide of barbarism mounts. The civilisation 
may still seem brilliant because it possesses an outward front, 
the work of a long past, but it is in reality an edifice 
crumbling to ruin, which nothing supports, and destined to fall 
in at the first storm. 
To pass in pursuit of an ideal from the barbarous to the 
civilised state, and then, when this ideal has lost its virtue, 
to decline and die, such is the cycle of the life of a people.

Fammiliar attitudes to life are found in the work of antifascist Wilhelm Reich in the essay ""Listen, Little Man!"" - an attack on social structure, society, individual pride and self worth 
		Listen, Little Man!  
""Listen, Little Man!"" reflects the inner turmoil of a scientist and physician who had observed the little man for many years and seen, first with astonishment, then with horror, what he does to himself; how he suffers, rebels, honors his enemies and murders his friends; how, wherever he acquires power ""in the name of the people,"" he misuses it and transforms it into something more cruel than the tyranny he had previously suffered at the hands of upperclass sadists. 
[...] 
It was felt that the ""common man"" must learn what a scientist and psychiatrist actually is and what he, the little man, looks like to his experienced eye. He must be acquainted with the reality which alone can counteract his ruinous craving for authority and be told very clearly what a grave responsibility he bears in everything he does, whether he is working, loving, hating, or just talking. 
	 
THEY CALL YOU Little Man, or Common Man. They say your day has dawned, the ""Age of the Common Man."" 
You don't say that, little man. They do, the vice presidents of great nations, the labor leaders, the repentant sons of the bourgeoisie, the statesmen and philosophers. They give you the future, but they ask no questions about your past. 
You've inherited a terrible past. Your heritage is a burning diamond in your hand. That's what I have to tell you. 
A doctor, a shoemaker, mechanic, or educator has to know his shortcomings if he is to do his work and earn his living. For several decades now you have been taking over, throughout the world. The future of the human race depends on your thoughts and actions. But your teachers and masters don't tell you how you really think and what you really are; no one dares to confront you with the one truth that might make you the unswerving master of your fate. You are ""free"" in only one respect: free from the self-criticism that might help you to govern your own life. 
I've never heard you complain: ""You exalt me as the future master of myself and my world. But you don't tell me how a man becomes a master of himself, and you don't tell me what's wrong with me, what's wrong with what I think and do."" 
You let the powerful demand power ""for the little man."" But you yourself are silent. You provide powerful men with more power or choose weak, malignant men to represent you. And you discover too late that you are always the dupe. 
I understand you. Because time and time again I've seen you naked in body and soul, without your mask, political label, or national pride. Naked as a newborn babe, naked as a field marshal in his underclothes. I've heard you weep and lament; you've told me your troubles, laid bare your love and yearning. I know you and understand you. I'm going to tell you what you are, little man, because I really believe in your great future. Because the future undoubtedly belongs to you, take a look at yourself. See yourself as you really are. Hear what none of your leaders or spokesmen dares to tell you: 
You're a ""little man,"" a ""common man."" Consider the double meaning of these words ""little"" and ""common""... 
Don't run away! Have the courage to look at yourself! 
""By what right are you lecturing me?"" I see the question in your frightened eyes. I hear it on your insolent tongue. You're afraid to look at yourself, little man, you're afraid of criticism, and afraid of the power that is promised you. What use will you make of your power? You don't know. You're afraid to think that your self--the man you feel yourself to be--might someday be different from what it is now: free rather than cowed, candid rather than scheming; capable of loving, not like a thief in the night but in broad daylight. You despise yourself, little man. You say ""Who am I that I should have an opinion, govern my life, and call the world mine?"" You're right: who are you to lay claim to your life? I will tell you who you are. 
You differ from a great man in only one respect: the great man was once a very little man, but he developed one important quality: he recognized the smallness and narrowness of his thoughts and actions. Under the pressure of some task which meant a great deal to him, he learned to see how his smallness, his pettiness, endangered his happiness. In other words, a great man knows when and in what way he is a little man. A little man does not know he is little and is afraid to know. He hides his pettiness and narrowness behind illusions of strength and greatness, someone else's strength and greatness. He's proud of his great generals but not of himself. He admires an idea he has not had, not one he has had. The less he understands something, the more firmly he believes in it. And the better he understands an idea, the less he believes in it. 
Let me begin with the little man in myself. 
For twenty-five years I've been speaking and writing in defense of your right to happiness in this world, condemning your inability to take what is your due, to secure what you won in bloody battles on the barricades of Paris and Vienna, in the American Civil War, in the Russian Revolution. Your Paris ended with Petain and Laval, your Vienna with Hitler, your Russia with Stalin, and your America may well end in the rule of the Ku Klux Klan! You've been more successful in winning your freedom than in securing it for yourself and others. This I knew long ago. What I did not understand was why time and again, after fighting your way out of a swamp, you sank into a worse one. Then groping and cautiously looking about me, I gradually found out what has enslaved you: YOUR SLAVE DRIVER IS YOU YOURSELF. No one is to blame for your slavery but you yourself. No one else, I say!	 
That's news to you, isn't it? Your liberators tell you that your oppressors are Wilhelm, Nicholas, Pope Gregory XXVIII, Morgan, Krupp, and Ford. And who are your liberators? Mussolini, Napoleon, Hitler, and Stalin. 
I say: Only you yourself can be your liberator!	 
At this point I hesitate. I claim to be a fighter for purity and truth. But now, after resolving to tell you the truth about yourself, I hesitate for fear of you and your attitude toward the truth. Truth is dangerous when it concerns you. Truth can be salutary, but any mob can preempt it. If that were not so, you would not be where you are. 
My reason says: Tell the truth at any cost. The little man in me says: It would be stupid to put yourself at the mercy of the little man. The little man doesn't want to hear the truth about himself. He doesn't want the great responsibility that has fallen to him, that is his whether he likes it or not. He wants to go on being a little man, or to become a little big man. He wants to get rich or become a party leader or head of the VFW or secretary of a society for moral uplift. But he does not want to assume responsibility for his work, for food supply, construction, mining, transportation, education, scientific research, administration, or what have you. 
The little man in me says: 
""You have become a great man, known in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, England, America, and Palestine. The Communists attack you. The 'saviors of cultural values' hate you. The sufferers from the emotional plague persecute you. You have written twelve books and 150 articles about the misery of life, the misery of the little man. Your work is taught at universities, other great, lonely men say you're a very great man. You are ranked among the giants of scientific thought. You have made the greatest discovery in centuries, for you have discovered the cosmic life energy and the laws of living matter. You have provided an understanding of cancer. You told the truth. For that you have been hunted from country to country. You've earned a rest. Enjoy your success and your fame. In a few years your name will be on all lips. You've done enough. Take it easy. Devote yourself to your work on the functional law of nature"" 
That's what the little man in me says, because he's afraid of you, little man. 
I was in close contact with you for many years, because I knew your life through my own and wanted to help you. I remained in contact with you, because I saw that I was indeed helping you and that you accepted my help willingly, often with tears in your eyes. Only very gradually did I come to see that you are capable of accepting help but not of defending it. I defended it and fought hard for you, in your stead. Then your leaders came and shattered my work. You followed them without a murmur. After than I remained in contact with you in the hope of finding a way to help you without being destroyed by you, either as your leader or as your victim. The little man in me wanted to win you over, to ""save"" you, to be regarded by you with the awe that you have of ""higher mathematics"" because you have no inkling of what it is. The less you understand, the greater your awe. You know Hitler better than Nietzsche, Napoleon better than Pestalozzi. A king means more to you than Sigmund Freud. The little man in me aspires to win you over, as you are ordinarily won over, with the tom-tom of leadership. I am afraid of you when the little man in me dreams of ""leading you to freedom."" You might discover yourself in me and me in yourself, take fright, and murder yourself in me. For this reason I am no longer willing to die for your freedom to be an indiscriminate slave.	 
You don't understand. I am aware that ""freedom to be an indiscriminate slave"" is anything but a simple idea. 
In order to progress from the status of faithful slave to a single master and become an indiscriminate slave, you must first kill the individual oppressor, the tsar for instance. You cannot commit such a political murder without revolutionary motives and a lofty ideal of freedom. Accordingly, you found a revolutionary freedom party under the leadership of a truly great man, let's say Jesus, Marx, Lincoln, or Lenin. This truly great man is dead serious about your freedom. If he wants practical results, he has to surround himself with little man, with helpers and executants, because the task is enormous and he can't handle it all by himself. Besides, you wouldn't understand him, you'd ignore him if he didn't gather little big men around him. Surrounded by little big men, he gains power for you, or a bit of truth, or a new and better faith. He writes testaments, issues laws to ensure freedom, counting on your help and serious willingness to help. He lifts you out of the social muck you had sunk into. In order to keep all the little big men together and not to forfeit your confidence, the truly great man is compelled, little by little, to sacrifice the greatness he had achieved in profound spiritual solitude, far from you and your daily tumult, yet in close contact with your life. In order to lead you, he must let you worship him as an unapproachable god. You would have no confidence in him if he went on being the simple man he was, if, for instance, he lived with a woman out of wedlock. Thus it is you who create your new master. Exalted to the rank of the new master, the great man loses his greatness, which consisted in integrity, simplicity, courage, and the closeness to the realities of life. The little big men who derive their prestige from the great man, take over the leading positions in finance, diplomacy, government, the arts and sciences--and you stay where you have always been all along, in the muck! You continue to go about in rags for the sake of the ""socialist future"" or the ""Third Reich."" You continue to live in mud huts daubed with cow dung. But you're proud of your Palace of People's power . . . Until the next war and the downfall of the new masters.	 
In far countries little men have closely studied your longing to be an indiscriminate slave. It has taught them how to become little big men with very little mental effort. These little men were not born in mansions, they rose from your ranks. They have gone hungry like you, suffered like you. And they have found a quicker way of changing masters. For a hundred years truly great thinkers made unstinting sacrifices, devoted their minds and lives to your freedom and well-being. The little men from your own ranks have found out that no such effort is needed. What truly great thinkers had achieved in a century of hardship and earnest thought they have managed to destroy in less than five years. Yes, the little men from your own ranks have found a shortcut--their method is more blatant and brutal. They tell you in so many words that you and your life, your children and family, count for nothing; that you are a feeble-minded flunky to be treated as it suits them. They promise you not individual but national freedom. They say nothing of self-respect but tell you to respect the state. They promise you not a personal greatness but national greatness. Since ""individual freedom"" and ""individual greatness"" mean nothing to you, while ""national freedom"" and ""national greatness"" stimulate your vocal cords in very much the same way as bones bring the water to a dog's mouth, the sound of these words makes you cheer. None of these little men pays the price that Giordano Bruno, Jesus, Karl Marx, or Lincoln had to pay for genuine freedom. They don't love you, little man, they despise you because you despise yourself. They know you through and through, much better than Rockefeller or the Tories know you. They know your worst weaknesses, as you ought to know them. They have sacrificed you to a symbol, and you have given them the power over you. You yourself have raised up your masters and you go on supporting them although--or perhaps because--they have cast of all masks. They have told you plainly, ""You are and always will be an inferior, incapable of responsibility."" You call them guides or redeemers, and shout hurrah, hurrah.	 
I'm afraid of you, little man, very much afraid, because the future of mankind depends on you. I'm afraid of you because your main aim in life is to escape--from yourself. You're sick, little man, very sick. It's not your fault; but it's your responsibility to get well. You'd have shaken off your oppressors long ago if you hadn't countenanced oppression and often given it your direct support. No police force in the world would have had the power to crush you if you had an ounce of self-respect in your daily life, if you were aware, really aware, that without you life could not go on for one hour. Has your liberator told you this? He called you ""Workers of the World,"" but he didn't tell you that you and you alone are responsible for your life (and not for the honor of the fatherland). 
You've got to realize that you have raised up your little men to be oppressors, and made martyrs of your truly great men; that you have never given a moment's thought to them or to what they have done for you; that you haven't the faintest idea who brought you the true benefits of your life. 
[...] 
I tell you, little man, you've lost all feeling for the best that is in you. You've stifled it. And when you find something worthwhile in others, in your children, your wife, your husband, your father or mother, you kill it. Little man, you're small and you want to stay small. 
How, you ask me, do I know all this? I'll tell you. 
I have known you, shared your experiences; I've known you in myself. As a physician I've freed you from what is small in you; as an educator I've often guided you in the path of integrity and openness. I know how bitterly you resist your integrity, what mortal fear comes over you when called upon to follow your own, authentic nature. 
You are not always small, little man. I know you have your ""great moments,"" your ""flights of enthusiasm"" and ""exaltation."" But you lack the perserverance to let your enthusiasm soar, to let your exaltation carry you higher and higher. You're afraid to soar, afraid of heights and depths. Nietzsche told you that long ago, far better than I can. He wanted to raise you up to be a superman, to surpass the merely human. His superman became your Fuhrer, Hitler. And you have remained what you were, the subhuman. 
I want you to stop being subhuman and become ""yourself."" ""Yourself."" I say. Not the newspaper you read, not your vicious neighbor's opinion, but ""yourself."" I know and you don't, what you really are deep down. Deep down, you are what a deer, your God, your poet, or your philosopher is. But you think you're a member of the VFW, your bowling club, or the Ku Klux Klan. And because you think so, you behave as you do. This too was told you long ago, by Heinrich Mann in Germany, by Upton Sinclair and John Dos Passos in the United States. But you recognize only the heavy weight champion and Al Capone. If given your choice between a library and a fight, you'll undoubtedly go to the fight. 
You plead for happiness in life, but security means more to you, even if it costs you your backbone or wrecks your whole life. Since you have never learned to seize upon happiness, to enjoy it and safeguard it, you lack the courage and integrity. Shall I tell you, little man, what kind of man you are? You listen to commercials on the radio, advertisements for laxatives, toothpaste, shoe polish, deodorants, and so on. But you are unaware of the abysmal stupidity, the abominable bad taste of the siren's tones calculated to catch your ear. Have you ever listened closely to a nightclub entertainer's jokes about you? About you, about himself, and your whole wretched world. Listen to your advertisements for better bowel movements and learn who and what you are.	 
Listen, little man! Every single one of your petty misdeeds throws a light on the wretchedness of human life. Every one of your petty actions diminishes the hope of improving your lot just a little more. That is ground for sorrow, little man, for deep, heartbreaking sorrow. To avert such sorrow you make silly little jokes. That's what you call your sense of humor. 
You hear a joke about yourself and you join in the laughter. You don't laugh because you appreciate humor at your own expense. You laugh at the little man without suspecting that you are laughing at yourself, that the joke is on you. And all the millions of little men fail to realize that the joke is on them. Why have you been laughed at so heartily, so openly, so maliciously, down through the centuries? Have you ever noticed how ridiculous the common people are made to look in the movies?	 
I will tell you why you are laughed at, little man, because I take you seriously, very seriously. 
Invariably you miss the truth in your thinking. You remind me of the whimsical sharpshooter who purposely misses the bull's eye by a hair's breadth. You disagree? I'll prove it. 
You could have become the master of your existence long ago if your thinking aimed at the truth. I'll give you an example of your thinking: 
""It's all the fault of the Jews,"" you say. ""What's a Jew?"" I ask. ""People with Jewish blood,"" you say. ""How do you distinguish Jewish blood from other blood?"" The question baffles you. You hesitate. Then you say, ""I meant the Jewish race."" ""What's race?"" I ask. ""Race? That's obvious. Just as there's a Germanic race, there's a Jewish race."" ""What are the characteristics of the Jewish race?"" ""A Jew has black hair, a long hooked nose, and sharp eyes. The Jews are greedy and capitalistic."" ""Have you ever seen a southern Frenchman or an Italian side by side with a Jew? Can you distinguish between them?"" ""No, not really . . ."" ""Then what's a Jew? His blood picture is the same as everyone else's. His appearance is no different from that of a Frenchman or an Italian. On the other hand have you ever seen any German Jews?"" ""They look like Germans."" ""What's a German?"" ""A German is a member of the Nordic Aryan race."" ""Are the Indians Aryans?"" ""Yes."" ""Are they Nordics?"" ""No."" ""Are they blond?"" ""No."" ""See? You don't even know what a Jew or a German is."" ""But Jews do exist!"" ""Of course Jews exist. So do Christians and Mohammedans."" ""That's right. I meant the Jewish religion."" ""Was Roosevelt a Dutchman?"" ""No."" ""Why do you call a descendant of David a Jew if you don't call Roosevelt a Dutchman?"" ""The Jews are different."" ""What's different?"" ""I don't know."" 
That's the kind of rubbish you talk, little man. And with such rubbish you set up armed gangs that kill ten million people for being Jews, though you can't even tell me what a Jew is. That's why you're laughed at, why anybody with anything serious to do steers clear of you. That's why you're up to your neck in muck. It makes you feel superior to call someone a Jew. It makes you feel superior because you feel inferior. You feel inferior because you yourself are exactly what you want to kill off in the people you call Jews. That's just a sampling of the truth about you, little man. 
When you contemptuously call someone a ""Jew,"" your sense of your own littleness is relieved. I discovered that only recently. You call anyone who arouses too much or too little respect in you a Jew. And as if you'd been sent down to earth by some higher power, you take it on yourself to decide who is a Jew. I contest that right, regardless of whether you're a little Aryan or a little Jew. No one but myself is entitled to say what I am. I am a biological and cultural mongrel and proud of it; in mind and body, I am a product of all classes and races and nations. I don't pretend to be racially or socially pure like you, or a chauvinist like you, petty fascist of all nations, races, and classes. I'm told that you didn't want a Jewish engineer in Palestine because he was uncircumcised. I have nothing more in common with Jewish fascists than with any other fascists. I am moved by no feelings for the Jewish language, Jewish religion, or Jewish culture. I believe in the Jewish God no more than in the Christian or Indian God, but I know where you get your God. I don't believe that the Jews are God's ""chosen people."" I believe that someday the Jewish people will lose themselves among the masses of human animals on this planet and that this will be a good thing for them and their descendants. You don't like to hear that, little Jewish man. You harp on your Jewishness because you despise yourself and those close to you as Jews. The Jew himself is the worst Jew hater of all. That's an old truth. But I don't despise you and I don't hate you. I simply have nothing in common with you, at any rate no more than with a Chinese or a raccoon, namely, our common origin in cosmic matter. Why do you stop at Shem, little Jew, why not go back to protoplasm? To my mind, life begins with plasmatic contraction, not with rabbinic theology. 
[...] 
Twenty-two years, twenty-two long, eventful, anguished years have passed since I began to teach you that what matters is not individual therapy but the prevention of psychic disorders. And again you're behaving as you've behaved for thousands of years. For twenty-two long fearful years I taught you that people succumb to madness of one kind or another or live in misery of one kind or another because they have become rigid in body and soul and because they are capable neither of enjoying love nor of giving it, because their bodies cannot, like those of all other animals, convulse in the act of love. 
Twenty-two years after I first told you so, to tell your friends that the essential is not the cure but the prevention of psychic disorders. But you go on behaving as you've behaved for thousands of years. You state the great aim, without mentioning how it's to be attained. You don't mention the love life of the masses. You want ""to prevent psychic disorders""--that much it's permissible to say--without going into the disaster of people's sexual lives--that is forbidden. As a physician, you're still up to your neck in the swamp. 
What would you think of an engineer who expounded the art of flying without revealing the secrets of the engine and propeller? That's what you do, you engineer of the human soul. Just that. You're a coward. You want the raisins out of my cake but you don't want the thorns of my roses. Haven't you too, little psychiatrist, been cracking silly jokes about me? Haven't you ridiculed me as ""the prophet of bigger and better orgasms""? Have you never heard the whimpering of a young wife whose body has been desecrated by an impotent husband? Or the anguished cry of an adolescent bursting with unfulfilled love? Does your security still mean more to you than your patient? How long will you go on valuing your respectability above your medical mission? How long will you refuse to see that your pussyfooting procrastination is costing millions of lives? 
You value security before truth. 
When you hear about my orgone, you don't ask, ""What can it do to cure the sick?"" No. You ask, ""Is he licensed to practice medicine in the state of Maine?"" Don't you realize that though you and your wretched licenses can obstruct my work a little, you can't stop it; that I have a worldwide reputation as the discoverer of your emotional plague and the investigator of your life energy; that no one is entitled to examine me unless he knows more than I do? 
You fritter away your freedom. No one has ever asked you, little man, why you haven't been more successful in winning freedom, or if you have won it, why you have quickly lost it to a new master. 
""Did you hear that? He has the gall to cast doubt on democracy and the revolutionary upsurge of the workers of the world. Down with the revolutionary, down with the counter-revolutionary! Down!"" 
Take it easy, little Fuhrer of all democrats and of the world proletariat. I am convinced that your real prospects of attaining freedom depend more on the answer to that one question than on ten thousand resolutions of your party congresses. 
""Down with him! He has insulted the nation and the vanguard of the revolutionary proletariat! Down with him! Stand him up against the wall!""	 
All your cries of ""Up"" and ""Down"" won't bring you one step closer to your goal, little man. You have always thought you could safeguard your freedom by standing people ""up against the wall."" You'd do better to stand yourself up to a mirror . . . 
""Down! . . ."" 
Take it easy, little man. I don't mean to insult you, I'm only trying to show you why you've never been able to win freedom, or to preserve it for any length of time. Doesn't that interest you all? 
""Do--o--own . . ."" 
[...] 
You come running to me and ask: ""Dear, good, great, Doctor! What should I do? What should we do? My whole house is collapsing, the wing is whistling through the cracks in the walls, my child is sick and my wife is miserable. I'm sick myself. What should I do? What should we do?"" 
""Build your house on granite. By granite I mean your nature that you're torturing to death, the love in your child's body, your wife's dream of life, your own dream of life when you were sixteen. Exchange your illusions for a bit of truth. Throw out your politicians and diplomats!	 
Take your destiny into your own hands and build your life on rock. Forget about your neighbor and look inside yourself! Your neighbor, too, will be grateful. Tell your fellow workers all over the world that you're no longer willing to work for death but only for life. Instead of flocking to executions and shouting hurrah, hurrah, make a law for the protection of human life and its blessings. Such a law will be a part of the granite foundation your house rests on. Protect your small children's love against the assaults of lascivious, frustrated men and women. Stop the mouth of the malignant old maid; expose her publicly or send her to a reform school instead of the young people who are longing for love. Don't try to outdo your exploiter in exploitation if you have a chance to become boss. Throw away your swallowtails and top hat, and stop applying for a license to embrace your woman. Join forces with your kind in all countries; they are like you, for better or worse. Let your child grow up as nature (or 'God') intended. Don't try to improve on nature. Learn to understand it and protect it. Go to the library instead of the prize fight, go to foreign countries rather than to Coney Island. And first and foremost, think straight, trust the quiet inner voice that tells you what to do. You hold your life in your hands, don't entrust it to anyone else, least of all to your chosen leaders. BE YOURSELF! Any number of great men have told you that.""	 
[...] 
In view of all this, I'm bidding you goodbye, little man. I will serve you no more, I refuse to let my concern for you torture me slowly to death. You can't follow me to the distant places I'm bound for. You'd be scared to death if you so much as suspected what the future has in store for you--because undoubtedly you're in the process of inheriting the earth, little man! My remote solitudes are a part of your future. But for the present I don't want you as a traveling companion. As a traveling companion you may be all right in a club car, but not where I'm going. 
""Kill him! He despises the civilization that I, the little man in the street, have built. I'm a free citizen of a free democracy. Hurrah!"" 
You're nothing, little man! Nothing whatever! You didn't build this civilization, it was built by a few of your more decent masters. Even if you're a builder, you don't know what you're building. If I or someone else were to say, ""Take responsibility for what you're building,"" you'd call me a traitor to the proletariat and flock to the Father of all Proletarians, who does not say such things. 
You're not free, little man, and you haven't the faintest idea what freedom is. You wouldn't know how to live in freedom. Who brought the plague to power in Europe? You little man! And in America? Think of Wilson! 
""Listen to him! He's accusing me, the little man! Who am I? What power have I to interfere with the President of the United States? I do my duty and obey orders. I don't meddle with politics."" 
When you drag thousands of men, women, and children to the gas chambers, you're only obeying orders. Is that right, little man? And you're so innocent you don't even know that such things are happening. And you're only a poor devil, whose opinion counts for nothing, who hasn't even got one. And who are you, anyway, that you should meddle with politics? I know, I know! I've heard all that many times. But then I ask: Why don't you do your duty in silence when a wise man tells you that you and you alone are responsible for what you do, or tries to persuade you not to beat your children, or pleads with you for the thousandth time to stop obeying dictators? What becomes of your duty, your innocent obedience, then? No, little man, when truth speaks, you don't listen. You listen only to bluster. And then you shout Hurrah! Hurrah! You're cowardly and cruel, little man; you have no sense of your true duty, which is to be a man and to preserve humanity. You imitate wise men so badly and bandits so well. Your movies and radio programs are full of murder. 
You will drag yourself and you meanness through many centuries before becoming your own master. I'm bidding you goodbye in order to work more effectively for your future, because when I'm far away you can't kill me, and you respect my work more in the distance than close at hand. You despise anything that's too close to you! That's why you put your proletarian general or marshal on a pedestal: then, however contemptible he may be, you can respect him. And that's why great men have given you a wide berth since the dawn of history.	 
""That's megalomania. The man is stark raving mad!"" 
I know, little man, you're very quick to diagnose madness when a truth doesn't suit you. You regard yourself as ""normal""!	 
You've locked up all the lunatics and the world is run by normal people. Then who's to blame for all the trouble? Not you, of course; you only do your duty, and who are you to have an opinion of your own? I know. You don't have to say it again. It's not you I'm worried about, little man! But when I think of your children, when I think how you torment the life out of them trying to make them ""normal"" life yourself, I almost want to come back to you and do what I can to stop your crimes. But I also know that you've taken precautions against that by appointing commissioners of education and child care.	 
I with I could take you on a little tour of the world, little man, to show you what you, as the ""apostle and embodiment of the people,"" are and have been, in the present and in the past, in Vienna, London, and Berlin. You'd find yourself everywhere and recognize yourself without difficulty, regardless of whether you're a Frenchman, a German, or a Hottentot, if only you had the courage to look at yourself. 
""He's insulting me, he's desecrating my mission!"" 
I'm not insulting you, little man, and I'm not desecrating your mission. I'll be only too glad if you show me I'm wrong, if you prove that you're capable of looking at yourself and recognizing yourself, if you can give me the same kind of proofs as I'd expect of a mason who's building a house. I'd expect him to show me that the house exists and is fit to live in. And if I prove that instead of building houses he merely talks about his ""mission to build houses,"" this mason will hardly be entitled to accuse me of insulting him. In the same light, it's up to you to prove that you are the apostle and the embodiment of man's future. It's no use trying to hide like a coward behind the ""honor"" of the nation, or of the proletariat, because you've already shown too much of your true nature. 
[...] 
A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE. I can't tell you what your future will be. I have no way of knowing whether you'll ever get to the moon or to Mars with the help of the cosmic orgone I have discovered. Nor can I know how your space ships will take off or land, whether you will light your houses with solar energy, or whether you will be able to talk with someone in Australia or Baghdad through a slit in the wall of your room. But I can tell you what you will definitely not do in five hundred or five thousand years. 
""Would you listen to that! He's a crank! He can tell me what I won't do! Is he a dictator?"" 
I'm not a dictator, little man, though, what with your smallness, I might easily have become one. Your dictators can tell you only what you can't do in the present without ending up in a gas chamber. They can no more tell you what you will do in the distant future than they can make a tree grow faster. 
""But where do you get your wisdom, you intellectual servant of the revolutionary proletariat?"" 
From your own depths, you eternal proletarian of human reason! 
""Listen to that! He gets his wisdom from my depths! I haven't got any depths. And what kind of individualistic talk is this, anyway!!"" 
Oh yes, little man, you have depths, but you don't know it. You're afraid, mortally afraid of your depths; that's why you neither feel them nor see them. That's why your head swims when you look into the depths, why you reel as if you were on the edge of a precipice. You're afraid of falling and losing your ""special character."" Because, try as you will to find yourself, it's always the same cruel, envious, greedy, thieving little man that turns up. I wouldn't have written this long appeal to you, little man, if you didn't have depths. And I know these depths in you, little man, because in my work as a physician I discovered them when you came to me with your affliction. Your depths are your great future. And that is why I can tell you what you will certainly not do in the future. A time will come when you won't even understand how you were able, in these four thousand years of unculture, to do all the things you have done. Now will you listen to me? 
""Why shouldn't I listen to a nice little utopia? In any case, nothing can be done about it my dear Doctor. I'll always be the little man of the people with no opinion of my own. And anyway, who am I to . . . ?"" 
Just be still! You're hiding behind the myth of the little man, because you're afraid of getting into the stream of life and of having to swim--if only for the sake of your children and grandchildren. 
All right. The first of all the many things you will not do in the future is to regard yourself as a little man with no opinion of his own, who says, ""Anyway, who am I to . . . ?"" You have an opinion of your own and in the future you will regard it as a disgrace not to know it, not to express it and stand up for it. 
""But what will public opinion say about my opinion? I'll be crushed like a worm if I express my own opinion!"" 
What you call ""public opinion,"" little man, is the aggregate of all the opinions of little men and women. Every little man and every little woman has inside him a sound opinion of his own and a particular kind of unsound opinion. Their unsound opinions spring from the fear of the unsound opinions of all the other little men and women. That's why the sound opinions don't come to light. For instance, you will no longer believe that you ""count for nothing."" You will know and proclaim that you are the mainstay and foundation of this human society. Don't run away! Don't be afraid! It's not so bad to be a responsible mainstay of human society. 
""What then must I do in order to be the mainstay of society?"" 
Nothing new or unusual. Just go on doing what you're already doing: till your field, wield your hammer, examine your patient, take your children out playing or to school, write articles about the events of the day, investigate the secrets of nature. You're already doing all these things, but you think they're unimportant and that only what Marshal Medalchest or Prince Blowhard says or does is important. 
""You're a dreamer, Doctor. Don't you see that Marshal Medalchest and Prince Blowhard have the soldiers and the arms needed to make war, to mobilize me for their war, and to blow my field, my factory, my laboratory, or my office to pieces?"" 
You get yourself mobilized, your field and your factory are blown to pieces, because you shout hurrah hurrah when they mobilize you and blow your factory and field to pieces. Prince Blowhard would have neither soldiers nor arms if you really knew that a field was for growing wheat and a factory for making furniture or shoes, that fields and factories were not made to be blown to pieces, and if you stood foursquare behind your knowledge. Your Marshal Medalchest and your Prince Blowhard don't know these things. They themselves don't work in a field, factory, or office. They think you work not to feed and clothe your children but for the grandeur of the German or the Workers' Fatherland. 
""Then what should I do? I hate war; my wife cries her heart out when I'm drafted, my children starve when the proletarian armies occupy my land, corpses pile up by the millions . . . All I want to do is till my field and play with the children after work, love my wife at night, and dance, sing, and make music on holidays. What should I do?"" 
Just go on doing what you've been doing and wanting to do all along: work, let your children grow up happily, love your wife at night. If you stuck to this program knowingly and single-mindedly there would be no war. Your wife wouldn't be fair game for the sex-starved soldiers of the Workers Fatherland, your orphaned children wouldn't starve in the streets, and you yourself wouldn't end up staring glassy-eyed at the blue sky on some far off ""field of honor."" 
""But supposing I want to live for my work and my wife and my children, what can I do if the Huns or Germans or Japanese or Russians or somebody else marches in, and forces me to make war? I have to defend my house and home, don't I? 
Right you are, little man. If the Huns of any nation attack you, you've got to pick up your gun. But what you fail to see if that the ""Huns"" of all nations are simply millions of little men like yourself who persist in shouting hurrah, hurrah when Prince Blowhard (who doesn't work) calls them to the colors; little men like yourself who believe that they count for nothing and ask, ""Who am I to have an opinion of my own?""	 
If once you knew that you do count for something, that you do have a sound opinion of your own, that your field and factory are meant to provide for life and not for death, then, little man, you yourself would be able to answer the question you've just asked. You wouldn't need any diplomats. You'd stop shouting hurrah, hurrah and laying wreaths on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. (I know your unknown soldier, little man. I got acquainted with him when I was fighting my mortal enemy in the mountains of Italy. He's the same little man as yourself, who thought he had no opinion of his own.) Instead of laying your national consciousness at the feet of your Prince Blowhard or your marshal of the world proletariat to be trampled on, you'd oppose them with your consciousness of your own worth and your pride in your work. You'd be able to get acquainted with your brother, the little man in Japan, China, and every other Hun country, to give him your sound opinion of your function as a worker, doctor, farmer, father, and husband, and convince him in the end that to make war impossible he need only stick to his work and his love. 
""That's all very well and good. But now they've made these atom bombs. A single one of them can kill hundreds of thousands of people!"" 
Use your head, little man! Do you think Prince Blowhard makes atom bombs? No, they're made by little man who shout hurrah, hurrah instead of refusing to make them. You see, little man, it all boils down to one thing, to you and your sound or unsound thinking. And you, the most brilliant scientist of the twentieth century, if you were not a microscopically little man, you'd have thought in terms of the world and not of any nation. Your great intellect would have shown you how to keep the atom bomb out of the world; or if the logic of scientific development made such an invention inevitable, you'd have brought all your influence to bear to prevent it from being used. You're caught in a vicious circle of your own making, and you can't get out of it because your thought and vision have taken the wrong direction. You comforted millions of little men by telling them your atomic energy would cure their cancer and rheumatism, though you were well aware that this was impossible, that you had devised an instrument of murder and nothing else. You and your physics have landed in the same blind alley. You know it, but you won't admit it. You're finished! Now and for all time! You know it, I've told you so very plainly. But you keep silent, you go on dying of cancer and a broken heart, and on your very deathbed you cry out, ""Long live culture and technology!"" I tell you, little man, that you've dug your own grave with your eyes open. You think the new ""era of atomic energy"" has dawned. It has dawned all right, but not in the way you think. Not in your inferno but in my quiet, industrious workshop in a far corner of America. 
It is entirely up to you, little man, whether or not you go off to war. If you only know that you're working for life and not for death! If you only knew that all little men on this earth are exactly like yourself, for better or worse. 
Someday ( how soon depends exclusively on you ) you'll stop shouting hurrah, hurrah. You'll stop telling fields and operating factories that are slated for destruction. Someday, I say, you'll no longer be willing to work for death but only for life. 
""Should I declare a general strike?"" 
I'm not so sure. Your general strike is a poor weapon. You'll be accused--and rightly so--of letting your own women and children starve. By going on strike you will be demonstrating your high responsibility for the weal or woe of your society. Striking is not working. I've told you that someday you would work for life, not that you'd stop working. If you insist on the word ""strike,"" calling it a ""working strike."" Strike by working for yourself, your children, your wife or woman, your society, your product, or your farm. Make it plain that you have no time for war, that you have more important things to do. Outside every big city on earth, mark off a field, build high walls around it, and there let the diplomats and marshals of the earth shoot each other. That's what you could do, little man, if only you'd stop shouting hurrah, hurrah and stop believing that you're a nobody without an opinion of your own . . . 
It's all in your hands, little man: not only your hammer or stethoscope but your life and your children's lives. You shake your head. You think I'm a utopian, if not a ""Red."" 
You ask me, little man, when you will have a good, secure life. The answer is alien to your nature. 
You'll have a good, secure life when being alive means more to you than security, love more than money, your freedom more than public or partisan opinion; when the mood of Beethoven's or Bach's music becomes the mood of your whole life--you have it in you, little man, somewhere deep down in a corner of your being; when your thinking is in harmony, and no longer in conflict, with your feelings; when you've learned to recognize two things in their season: your gifts and the onset of old age; when you let yourself be guided by the thoughts of great sages and no longer by the crimes of great warriors: when you cease to set more store by a marriage certificate than by love between man and woman; when you learn to recognize your errors promptly and not too late, as you do today; when you pay the men and women who teach your children better than politicians; when truths inspire you and empty formulas repel you; when you communicate with your fellow workers in foreign countries directly, and no longer through diplomats; when instead of enraging you as it does today, your adolescents daughter's happiness in love makes your heart swell with joy; when you can only shake your head at the memory joy; when you can only shake your head at the memory of the days when small children were punished for touching their sex organs; when the human faces you see on the street are no longer drawn with grief and misery but glow with freedom, vitality, and serenity; when human bodies cease to walk this earth with rigid, retracted pelvises and frozen sex organs. 
You ask for guidance and advice, little man. For thousands of years you have had guidance and advice, good and bad. Not bad advice but your own smallness is to blame for your persistent wretchedness. I could give you good advice, but in view of the way you think and are, you wouldn't be able to convert it into action for the benefit of all. 
If, for instances, I advised you to put an end to all diplomacy and replace it by your professional and personal brotherhood with all the shoemakers, blacksmiths, carpenters, mechanics, engineers, physicians, educators, writers, administrators, miners, and farmers of England, Germany, Russia, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Palestine, Arabia, Turkey, Scandinavia, Tibet, Indonesia, and so on; to let all the miners work out the best way of preventing human beings all over the world from suffering from cold; to let the educators of all countries and nations determine the best way of safeguarding the world's children against impotence and psychic disorder in later life; and so on. What would you do, little man, if confronted with these self-evident truths? 
Assuming for the moment that you didn't have me locked up as a ""Red,"" you would reply in person or through some spokesman of your party, church, trade union, or government: 
""Who am I to replace diplomatic relations between countries by international relations based on work and social achievement?"" 
Or: ""There's no way of overcoming the discrepancies in the economic and social development of the various countries."" 
Or: ""Wouldn't it be wrong to associate with the fascist Germans or Japanese, the Communist Russians, or the capitalistic Americans?"" 
Or: ""What interests me first and foremost is my Russian, German, American, English, Jewish, or Arab fatherland."" 
Or: ""It's all I can do to manage my own life and get along with my garment workers' union. Let someone else worry about the garment workers of other countries."" 
Or: ""Don't listen to that capitalist, Bolshevist, fascist, Trotskyite, internationalist, sexualist, Jew, foreigner, intellectual, dreamer, utopian, fake, crank, lunatic, individualist, and anarchist! Where's your American, Russian, German, English, or Jewish patriotism?"" 
You would undoubtedly use one of these statements, or another of some sort, as an excuse for shirking your responsibility for human communication. 
""Am I then utterly worthless? You don't give me credit for one ounce of decency. You make hash out of me. But look here. I work hard, I support my wife and children, I try to lead a good life, I serve my country. I can't be as bad as all that!""	 
I know you're a decent, industrious, cooperative animal, comparable to a bee or an ant. All I've done is to lay bare the little man in you, who has been wrecking your life for thousands of years. You are great, little man, when you're not mean and small. Your greatness, little man, is the only hope we have left. You're great when you attend lovingly to your trade, when you take pleasure in carving and building and painting, in sowing and reaping, in the blue sky and the deer and the morning dew, in music and dancing, in your growing children, and in the beautiful body of your wife or husband; when you go to the planetarium to study the stars, to the library to read what other men and women have thought about life. You're great when your grandchild sits on your lap and you tell him of times long past and look into the uncertain future with his sweet, childlike curiosity. You're great, mother, when you lull your baby to sleep; when with tears in your eyes you pray fervently for his future happiness; and when hour after hour, year after year, you build this happiness in your child.	 
You're great, little man, when you sing the good, warmhearted folk songs, or when you dance the old dances to the tune of an accordion, because folk songs are good for the soul, and they're the same the world over. And you're great when you say to your friend: 
""I thank my fate that I've been able to live my life free from filth and greed, to see my children grow and to look on as they first began to babble, to take hold of things, to walk, to play, to ask questions, to laugh and to love; that I've been able to preserve, in all its freedom and purity, my feeling for the springtime and its gentle breezes, for the gurgling of the brook that flows past my house and the singing of the birds in the woods; that I've taken no part in the gossip of malicious neighbors; that I've been happy in the embrace of my wife or husband and have felt the stream of life in my body; that I haven't lost my bearings in troubled times, and that my life has had meaning and continuity. For I have always hearkened to the gentle voice within me that said, 'Only one thing matters: live a good, happy life. Do your heart's bidding, even when it leads you on paths that timid souls would avoid. Even when life is a torment, don't let it harden you.'"" 
When on quiet evenings after the day's work I sit om the meadow outside the house with my beloved or my child, alert to the breathing of nature, then a song that I love rises up in me, the song oh humanity and its future: ""Seid umschlungen, Millionen . . ."" And then I implore this life to claim its rights and change the hearts of cruel or frightened men who unleash wars. They do it only because life has escaped them. And I hug my little boy, who says to me, ""Father! The sun has gone away. Where has the sun gone? Will it come back soon?"" And I say, ""Yes, my boy, the sun will come back soon with its kindly warmth."" 
I have come to the end of my appeal to you, little man. I could have gone on indefinitely. But if you've read my words attentively and candidly, you will be able to recognize the little man in you even in connections I haven't mentioned. For one and the same state of mind is at the bottom of all your mean actions and thoughts. 
Regardless of what you've done and will do to me, of whether you glorify me as a genius or lock me up as a madman, of whether you worship me as your deliverer or hang or torture me as a spy, your affliction will force you to recognize sooner or later that I have discovered the laws of living energy and have given you an instrument with which to govern your lives with the conscious purpose which thus far you have applied only to the operation of machines. I have been a faithful engineer to your organism. Your grandchildren will follow in my footsteps and become wise engineers of human nature. I have opened up to you the vast realm of the living energy within you, your cosmic essence. That is my great reward. 
And to the dictators and tyrants, the crafty and malignant, the vultures and hyenas, I cry out in the words of an ancient sage: 
I have planted the banner of holy words in this world. 
Long after the palm tree has withered and the rock crumbled, 
long after the glittering monarchs have vanished like the dust of dried leaves, 
a thousand arks will carry my word through every flood: 
It will prevail.

	My fellow Americans:
 


	Our meeting here tonight is symbolic—symbolic for a deep and wide unrest now going through the American people. This growing unrest arises from an awareness throughout all of our people that somehow, somewhere something is wrong. It does not fall to everyone to devote his life to the service of his people, but it is the duty of him who has made this decision to represent—truly to represent, in the most spiritual sense that of that word—his nation. It is for him to actualize the innermost feelings of the national soul; it is for him to make clear and articulate that which everyone dimly feels. It is his duty, because he is himself only the voice of his nation and his people.
 


	Therefore, I am not going to burden you with purely personal ideas—I am going to answer the question in your minds and hearts: what is wrong in our land? Nor will I use the alien terminology of the Marxists whether from Moscow or Washington. Our enemies like to use involved and complicated explanations why their policy abroad is necessary, why America must continually retreat before advancing Communism, why American blood must be spilt in a war in which American victory on the battlefield is forbidden by the American government. But I will use only your language, which is my language; when I mean war, I shall say war, when I mean peace, I shall call it that, and when I mean treason, I shall say treason.
 


	Have you ever noticed that the Truman-Acheson regime says war when it means peace, and says peace when it means war? In Korea, tonight, American blood is being spilt in defeat and Americans are dying in cold, in isolation, in despair. What does the Washington regime say to this? It says: “By our clever diplomacy we are preventing the Third World War.” Fellow Americans, they lie! Korea is the Third World War, and our rulers are leading America to a defeat in that war!
 


	It is a shocking thing to say, and to contemplate, is it not? To think that men, entrusted before God and the world with the conduct of America’s destiny would coldly and deliberately prefer the interests of America’s enemy to the interests of this American nation. Because of the enormity of this crime, most of us hesitate even to think of such an explanation of events, and we only realize it with the greatest reluctance, when every other explanation is excluded.
 


	As an American who has watched the steady descent of his country from this high point of 1945,when human affairs of 9/10ths of this earth were under the control of America, as an American who had felt himself humiliated as he has watched his country’s humiliation at the hands of the Communist Barbarians of Moscow, as an American veteran of America’s armed forces who is forced every day to read in the press a new list of hopeless American casualties, I have no joy in recounting to you the vicious story of treason in our country. It gives me no pleasure to tell you things which never ought to have happened within our land. But, regardless of everything else, my first duty is to tell you the truth—and in particular that very truth which the Washington regime is so intent upon concealing.
 


	I would like to think, as would you also, that the explanation of America’s continuous and endless succession of defeats and humiliations, America’s progressive loss of power in the world, is simple incompetence on the part of the Executive branch of the government. Perhaps these people simply, do not know how to seek and acquire allies, perhaps they do not understand how to strike salutary fear into the hearts of the Kremlin barbarians as they proceed on their self-appointed task of the conquest of the world. Perhaps the Truman-Acheson regime would like to win in the present war with China, but they do not known how to manage a war.
 


	This explanation could possibly be accepted if we did not still have before us, present in the memory of every person in this meeting, the entire Second World War. In that War, the entire Communist faction in the Washington regime was wholeheartedly in favor of victory.
 


	In this war, as we all know, the Communist faction desires an American defeat. Let us compare the two wars, and we shall see develop before us America’s Two Ways of Waging War.
 


	First of all, what was the objective of the Second World War? It was given to the world as unconditional surrender! They wanted total victory, and they said so. But what is the objective of the Chinese War now going on? In Acheson’s words, it is “a just truce.” Not even peace! Much less victory. No question of unconditional surrender. Marshall as Secretary of Defense visited the battlefront and there announced to the press that the American mission in Korea is “to prevent the enemy from coming below the 38th parallel.” Did he make a similar announcement when America was fighting Germany and Italy? No, when he wanted victory, he said so, and he subscribed to the “Unconditional Surrender” formula.
 


	Next, during the present Chinese war, the whole regime in Washington says we must prevent the conflict from spreading, we must localize the conflict. What did they want in the Second World War? They wanted a continual extension of the front, continual involvement of other powers. They exerted every conceivable pressure to bring other powers in on their side. When they had two fronts, they wanted a third, and when they had that, they wanted a fourth. They wanted to win that war.
 


	Next, did they refuse any offers of troops in the Second World War? On the contrary they used every pressure on neutrals to extract troops from them to sue against Germany and Italy. But in the present war against Red China, they have refused Chiang-Kai-Chek’s standing offer of 500,000 combat-ready troops. Not only do they refuse this offer, but they have ordered the American Navy to blockade Chiang-Kai-Chek so that he cannot strike the Chinese Communists. Yes, tonight, as we meet here, the American Navy is protecting Red China.
 


	On the same point, South Korea under Synghman Rhee, our ally in the war against Red China, does not even have conscription of its manpower to defend the soil of Korea, nor has the Truman-Acheson regime put any pressure on South Korea to raise more troops by conscription. Not like the Second World War, is it? Then, they sought to get troops even from neutrals. Now, they refuse troops, even from allies. The difference is, that they wanted to win that war. You see, Russia and the Communist faction also wanted victory in that war.
 


	In every war mistakes occur, and they occurred in the Second World War. More than once, American land forces and American air forces fired upon one another. More than once, American field headquarters were bombed by American planes. But these incidents were not magnified out of all proportion and spread across the land in great headlines. But, remember the scandal that was created out of the incident in Korea in the winter of 1950 when certain American units did not received their proper winter clothing? It is the operation of the Communist faction in the press and government which resolves this riddle. In the Second World War they wanted no military scandals to undermine public confidence in the command, to damage public morale. In the current war, the exact opposite is true. The want scandal which will break down public confidence and morale, which will lay the groundwork for defeat.
 


	Next, remember how the press, in the Second World War, continually told, us of the imminent defeat of German, Italy and Japan? We were told every day—it won’t be long now, our victory is assured, we only need keep up the fight a little longer. Now what is the line, now that we are fighting Communism and Red armies? Now we learn that the war would be endless if it were extended, that we can never gain victory over the enemy, that Russia is getting stronger day by day, that Russian plane production exceeds ours, and that their planes and tanks are better, their man-power is greater, that the best we can hope for is to pay them tribute to let us live in peace.
 


	Do you see how the pattern emerges, in unmistakable clarity, in utter simplicity? No wonder the inner enemy wants us to be confused by a thousand viewpoints, distracted by scandals, and twisted into knots by his perverted explanations of his treasonable diplomacy. All you need to do it sort out the facts, and the big issue is there: in its stark greatness, it dominates the entire American political landscape. Involved in this issue is the entire future of our land, our nation, our people. Either we meet this challenge, or our nation and everything that we have ever been known in world history by the name America will go down into permanent darkness.
 


	Fellow Americans, look once more at the Second World War, the war against Germany. In selecting the leadership for that war, political and military, did our rulers select men with pro-German backgrounds, with a long record of affiliation with Germany, men who dealt publicity and privately with Germany’s leadership? On the contrary, any such persons were purged at once from positions of leadership, and only pronounced anti-Germans were entrusted with the conduct of the war against Germany. Regard now the present war against Red China, especially the moment of its beginning: in their theory, who are the participants in the war? The United Nations on the one side, the Republic of North Korea on the other. But who is entrusted with the conduct of the war, in theory? The Security Council of the United Nations—and in June 1950, at the beginning of the Korean War, this organ was presided over by a Russian delegate, the personal representative of Stalin. Here then we had American armies fighting under the command of an alien organization called the United Nations, and under the theoretical command of its Security Council presided over the enemy. When we fought Germany, were we ever a member of an alliance which embraced Germany, and presided over by a German representative?
 


	Look again at the United Nations: the Secretary-General of this—should I say—organization, is a man named, most appropriately, Lie, spelled L-I-E. This man was nominated for this position by Russia, and he has continued during his tenure of office to merit the confidence of the Russians. His mission there is to see that Russian interests are not damaged, and he visits the Kremlin from time to time to report and consult.
 


	Yet this is the organization for whose artificial flag American blood is being daily spilt, spilt heroically as far as the individuals are concerned, spilt in defeat as far as American national interests are concerned. When the American Navy bombards the enemy coast of Korea, the United Nations flag is run up, and American land forces fly this alien flag over their headquarters. Compare it with the Second World War. Were American soldiers told they were fighting for some abstraction, some League of Nations or other? No, because every leader knows that his nation will only give its best and sacrifice the most in the name of its own nation, a living, breathing reality, and in the sign of the symbol of that nation, clothed with its history, drenched by its blood, bound up with its honor. In the Second World War they wanted victory so they used the American flag, which has always been attended with victory. In the present war against Communism, they want a defeat of American arms, so they use an abstract flag representing nothing more than an office building in New York, the 2nd League of Nations, doomed, as we all know, to go the way of the first League of Nations.
 


	During the Second World War, against Germany, no part of the press, and no one in the government, spoke of a truce, or of a peace. It was treated as quite self-evident that whoever sought peace was approaching treason. Now, however, when we are fighting against world-communism, our rulers talk of a “just truce,” whatever that is.
 


	When the Red enemy finally consented to enter into truce talks—for his own purposes—he stipulated that the American delegate approach the conference through a gauntlet of Red bayonets, and carrying the white flag. This vile and dishonorable sight was then photographed and spread over all Asia as the sign of America’s surrender to Asiatic Reds. The illiterates of Mongolia, Burma, and India, to whom a newspaper means nothing, nevertheless understand the language of pictures, and know the meaning of the white flag. Why was this abject and vile performance kept from the American people? Compare it with the Second World War: did anyone ever suggest going to the Germans with the white flag? If he had, the Democratic administration would have prosecuted him for treason.
 


	Another point: do you remember those first months of the war in Korea, when the only enemy in the field was the North Korean Red Army? During that period, the entire American press, and members of the administration prompted them, continually spoke of the possible intervention of China in the war. It was started as natural and normal that China would intervene against us, and no measures were contemplated, suggested, or discussed to prevent that intervention. Was there anything like this is the Second World War? Was it not treated as self-evident that if anyone entered the war it would be on our side? After all, Red China was created by the Truman-Acheson administration, and Marshall was the mid-wife who delivered this monster into life. No, the threatened intervention of China—not threatened by China, but by the Washington regime and by the Communist faction in the American press—was used as a further reason for inculcating defeatism, and for mollifying America’s conduct of the war.
 


	Where in all this clear pattern of events do we find any ambiguity? How could mere stupidity, however gross, account for this systematic and continuing anti-American conduct? Look at the picture: American troops are in the field, they are fighting for their lives against huge odds, dependent for their bare survival upon their technical superiority in weapons and transport, dependent for their victory upon that same superiority. These American troops are armed—thank God for the technical superiority of Western Civilization!—with atomic weapons against which the Red Chinese enemy cannot retaliate. This superior weapon, which brought about the surrender of the Japanese empire within a week of its employment, is held back by our rulers. Did they hold back any weapon in the Second World War?
 


	What reason do they give for this refusal to exploit every possible means to give victory to American arms, power to America, and life to American soldiers who tomorrow may be dead in this treasonable war in which victory is forbidden? They say: “We don’t want to anger the enemy, or the neutral, like the pro-Communist Nehru. We don’t, above all, want to spread the war, because Russia might intervene, and then, naturally, we would lose.” Did they refrain from the mass bombing of German and Japanese cities because it might make anybody angry? They would have pushed anyone aside who didn’t like it. They were determined on victory and unconditional surrender, and they were prepared to use any amount and any form of armed force against anybody whatsoever to achieve their purpose. From the beginning Nehru has been the spokesman for Red Chinese interests, so in that quarter we have no sympathy and no neutrality to lose. As to the argument about Russia: it is a crass and vile lie that Russia could defeat the United States in a military contest, and those in high places who say it know that it is a lie. If they believe it, they would be cowards, but they are worse than cowards, they are liars, using their lies to support their treason.
 


	I am not yet finished with this matter of the atomic bomb. Fellow Americans, God made this world as it is, and in its ever-recurring forms we dimly perceive his divine plan. World-history, in which America is now caught up, involved for its very life in the tempest of events, is the history of nations. The units of history are nations. Those individuals who lead those nations owe their primary duty to that nation whose destiny God has placed temporarily in their hand. It is not allowed to a ruler to sacrifice his people on the battlefield to abstract aims like United Nations of some kind or other, like humanitarian principles of one kind or another; it is the duty of every government of every form to serve the national interests, and no government has the right to expend one single soldier for any other purpose.
 


	It is thus the duty of the American military high command—and Truman, with Acheson hovering over him, is the supreme commander-in-chief—to bring victory to American arms in order to save American lives. In that duty every reasonable means of achieving victory must be pursued, including the use of atomic weapons to the utmost.
 


	Six years ago, to justify the atomic bombardment of Japan, did not Truman officially state that it was done to terminate the war quickly and thus to save American lives? His reason was sound then—why is it not sound today?
 


	It is not sound today, to the minds of the Truman-Acheson regime, because the aim of the present war against Red China is not victory, it is not unconditional surrender, it is not to save American lives. Six years ago this regime knew how to fight—can we believe that today it is longer knows how to fight? Would Truman, Acheson, and the entire Communist faction dare to appear on this platform and answer the questions of this audience here tonight?
 


	Fellow Americans, I say to you now, and beyond this audience I say it to the entire American people and nation, and I say it with every ounce of seriousness and purpose I possess: The war in which America is now engaged is being waged not for American victory, but for Communist victory, and these in America who are ultimately responsible for the conduct of this war are guilty of black, damnable treason. Think of the Second World War on the question of prisoners-of-war: if any American legal officer had announced that Germany had killed 5,000 American prisoners-of-war, would he not have had a favorable and continuous press, would not the high command have given him every assistance in his task of investigation and proof?
 


	We know they would. Yet how was it with Col. James Hadley, the judge advocate of the Army in Korea announced that he had proof of Communist slaughter of 5,000 American war-prisoners? He was immediately summoned to Tokyo for discipline. The command in Tokyo stated that he should have made announcement under their conditions, that he was injuring their plans by exposing Communist atrocities at that particular time. It was given a poor press, and Truman’s reaction to it was “If it is true, it is the worst thing that had happened in the century.” Note that “If it is true—.” It prepares the public to disbelieve it, to greet this American officer’s statement with suspicion, to wait and see. Editorials in the American press, slipped in by members of the Communist faction, counselled the public not to get excited, to wait and see—in other words: wait and forget. And up to now, what has been done about this massacre of American soldiers, surrendered and disarmed? Absolutely nothing. The Communist enemy has in no way been deterred from future massacres.
 


	And yet, my friends, I know what Washington, Hamilton, or Andrew Jackson would have done.
 


	During the Second World War, the Washington regime was not face with a great problem of an inner enemy. Nevertheless, it interned and uprooted all the Japanese on the West Coast and numerous German-born men and women all over the land. The vast majority of all internees were American citizens, but nobody worried much about their “civil liberties.”
 


	During the present war with Red China, however, everything is different. The inner enemy is numerous, highly organized, thoroughly indoctrinated, with a literature of class war, proletarian dictatorship, and world conquest going back a century. At the very narrowest, the inner enemy includes the Communist Party and affiliated organizations; more realistically it includes also the Communist sympathizers and backers of Communist-front organizations, many of whom are high in positions in the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of the Federal and State governments. Although we are in a state of actual war with Communism, with Red China backed by Red Russia, no measures have been taken against the dangerous and powerful inner enemy, who is actually in a position, as every day’s news tells us, to destroy the American war effort and kill American soldiers on the battlefield from behind.
 


	One feeble measure attempted: an “anti-Communist bill” was passed by Congress, over the powerful opposition of the Executive branch of the government, requiring all Communists to register. Truman vetoed this anti-Communist bill, and it was passed over his veto. When it went into effect however, all Communists publicly and openly defied its provisions, and refused to register. Nothing was done to them, because the whole bill was drafted in such a way that it could not be enforced because of the vagueness of its provisions, and because there was no penal sanction to the measure. Was this an accident?
 


	Why was it impossible to draft a real anti-Communist law?
 


	Did they proceed this way during the Second World War against Germans and Japanese?
 


	Think again of the Second World War: Were American troops, in the presence of the enemy, and without a truce being in effect, ever ordered to cease their fire? And yet this happened not three months since, in Korea. Company units, in the face of the enemy received an order, of which press correspondents there on the spot were informed, to refrain from firing on the enemy, except in self-defense. The order, once given, attributed to the “highest sources of command,” was suddenly revoked, and its very issuance was denied, as a result of the strong reaction of the American nation to this unbelievable scandal.
 


	Is there anyone so blind that this glaring Red light does not illuminate the American political landscape for him?
 


	Look at the list of Communist spies: Eisler, Hiss, Coplon, Guibychev, the Rosenbergs. Not one of them has received a punishment commensurate with his crime and sufficient to deter others from engaging in espionage. Eisler was allowed to escape. Hiss was tried on a charge minor in comparison to his real offense of espionage and given a short term from which he will soon be free. Coplon was released on a foolish technicality. Guibychjev was set free to go to Russia. The Rosenbergs were condemned to death on a charge of treason, but it was clear at the time and it is clear now that these spies are being protected: they will never receive the death penalty, and their case will be reversed on appeal. Note what I say, and then observe your newspapers.
 


	Look for a moment at these men who are leading or who have led, the American war effort against Red China. There is Truman, whose pet name for Stalin is good old Joe, the man who played the piano for Stalin and Potsdam, even as he was giving him half the world. Look at Acheson, the leader of the pro-Russian clique during the entire Second World War, the member of a law firm which has represented Communist interests for 20 long years, the co-architect, with Marshall, of the Red Chinese State with which we are now at war, the bitter opponent of General MacArthur, whose first offense was that he refused to kow-tow to Russia in the Far East. Look at Marshall, the man, who as Chief of Staff of a great world power in a time of crisis, did not member where he was on the morning of the Pearl Harbor attack, the man who continually during the Second World War sacrificed the needs of MacArthur’s command in the Pacific to Russian needs in Europe, the man who undertook the mission to destroy the state of Chiang Kai-Chek, the firm ally of America, the man who gave decisive aid to the Red Chinese in the Civil War and thus at one stroke lost one-quarter of the world to Russia, the man who has had private conversations with Stalin, and has not thought it necessary to tell the American people what was discussed in those secret conversations. In the Second World War, they did not choose men of backgrounds friendly to Germany and to Germany’s leadership to carry on the war, but for the Third World War against Russian-directed Communism, the crusaders to lead it are men who have been distinguished by pro-Russian activity.
 


	A hollow and stinking crusade! A crusade in a vacuum! A crusade which does not want to win!
 


	Was there ever an instance, in the Second World War, in which an American general, who had held the highest military commands within the power of his nation confer on him, covered with the glories of his numerous victories, was removed from his command because he wanted to win the war? Of course there was not—the Washington regime wanted to win that war, so it encouraged and honored victorious generals. But in the Third World War, in which we are now engaged, which we are daily losing, and in which every day we are faced with a new scandal, a new lie, a new treason—everything is different. General MacArthur was disgracefully removed from command, and his offense was that he wanted to win the war.
 


	In very truth, America has two ways of waging war. One for victory, and one for defeat.
 


	Fellow Americans, we have stood in the pence of some awful truths tonight, we have contemplated some terrible things, we have witnessed the foulest of all crimes, the crime of treason. We have looked into the form of events, and the events have yielded up their mystery to us. Now that we know precisely what is wrong in our great land, what is our response?
 


	It is one of the things for which we must be grateful that the Communist faction does not yet have sufficient power to prevent free elections, nor to stifle the public voice, nor prevent public organization in self-defense against the Communist advance within America. Twenty years ago, if anyone had foretold that in the time to come an American military commander would be dismissed for trying to bring victory to American arms, he would have been called a lunatic. Yet we have sense just that. If this pattern of events continues, twenty years from today the Communists will be embarking on their final mopping-up operations in their total destruction of everything the idea America has stood for in the history of nations. Perhaps they would have the assistance of barbarian troops from Russia. Perhaps that would not be necessary. If Americans are nothing but peace-seeking slaves who will pay tribute for peace, who will pay ransom to an enemy who kidnaps American airmen, the destruction of America from within will be easy.
 


	But that is not to be, and one proof of it is this very gathering here tonight.
 


	Tonight I have only been your voice saying what you feel and think. If these were only my personal thoughts, they would not be interesting, but these thoughts correspond to the feelings of the great mass of our people stretching from ocean to ocean, from the deserts of the Southwest to Maine’s rocky coast. If that which has been said here were only my personal ideas, you would not have come, nor would I be here. When I went into public life, I did not enter it for my own advantage and in public life I have always had the choice of saying the popular thing and getting praise from America’s powerful enemies, or of saying the truthful thing and being smeared and calumniated by those enemies, enemies of America, of you, and therefore, of me.
 


	They have invented a word, McCarthyism. A clever trick, they thought. The idea was to make everybody think that I am something unique, some sort of wild individualist, somebody all alone. Their trick has not worked. I give it the lie right now. There is no such thing as McCarthyism—what they mean is Americanism.
 


	When I give voice to an idea which is not in accord with the entire spirit of America and its history, an idea which is not in furtherance of America’s destiny, of America’s power, prestige, and honor in the world—then, but not until then, will there be such a thing as McCarthyism. Up until that time—no matter what America’s internal enemies chatter about, your enemies and mine—I shall speak only in the American spirit.
 


	Part of the campaign of treason is defeatism: Russia is too strong for us; let us be careful; don’t use our superior weapons; someone might not like it if we win; let’s ransom our soldiers and be quiet about it; a new Communistic day has dawned in Asia; Communism means hope for the Asiatic masses. You have heard it all, and it has nauseated you.
 


	I am not such a fool, nor such a contemptible coward to bring you any brand of defeatism. If I thought America was doomed to defeat and Communist extinction, I would still continue to fight to my last breath. But I don’t’ believe in any such thing: I believe in the spiritual resources of this nation. I believe that far from being exhausted, they have scarcely being tapped. America has only written its first pages in history, and not its last. I believe in the future of the Western Civilization, of which America is an integral part. I know, deep down inside me, that the future belongs to us who are part of this Civilization and whom share its great world mission.
 


	I summon you, not to a Korea-type war in which to seek, and find defeat, but to a war for victory. This, our immediate war is not far beyond our shores, it is here, in our own land, against the inner enemy. How can we conscientiously ask an American soldier to fight a foreign enemy under the command of the Truman-Acheson regime which has been guilty of such monstrous conduct, whose members have been pro-Russian all of their lives, a regime which cannot possibly be trusted to lead a war against Communism, honeycombed with Communist sympathizers and agents as it is?
 


	It is not a part of the divine plan that a great superpersonal force working for order and creativeness in the world, like the Western Civilization, is to be overcome by an onslaught of barbarians against an America weakened by corruption and betrayed by a horde of achesons.
 


	The inner enemy, like the Red Chinese Armies in Korea, has not earned any of his victories. They have been presented to him by the marshalls and achesons. But America is coming back. We shall pull ourselves and our nation out of this swamp of treason, corruption, and disgust.
 


	We shall liberate our land from the domination of traitors, and then, by the help of the Almighty God, we shall restore the word America to its old meaning in the world before all nations.
 


	By the deluge of our votes, by the irresistible storm of our organized protest, we shall sweep America clear of its inner enemies and onward to its God-given Destiny.

	KITA IKKI
 


	Introduction 
	The great empire of Japan is at a national turning point as it confronts internal troubles and foreign danger. A majority of the citizens face an uncertain future and seek to learn from the collapse of European states while those who control political, military and financial power for their private ends bury their heads in their sleeves and timidly try and sustain their illegitimate authority. Abroad, be it Britain, the United States, Germany, Russia, there is not a single power that has not violated its word; even our neighbor China, to whom we have provided protection since the Russo-Japanese War, has rewarded us with contempt. Truly, we are a small island isolated in the Eastern Sea. There is a danger that the country established by our ancestors will disappear if we make one miscalculation for we see again the danger of internal troubles and foreign danger that our country faced at the end of Tokugawa period and the Meiji Restoration. 
	The only light that brightens this picture is from the sixty million countrymen that heaven has given us. it is necessary for the citizens of Japan to firmly grasp the fundamental principles 
	of the existence of the nation and of the human right of the equality of citizens and to be able to discriminate and select without confusing the pure and impure elements of domestic and foreign ideas. The First World War was like a punishment from heaven for the arrogant behaviour of European nations comparable to Noah's Flood. We certainly cannot expect plans to rebuild from those who are in a frenzied and confused state after the great destruction, but for out Japan the situation has been the opposite, and these five years have been of blessings. Europe should talk of reconstruction while we need to proceed with reorganization. All of the citizens of Japan should think with a cool heart of the fundamental reasons for the difference in heaven's rewards and punishment, how the basis for the reorganization of Japan that is desired can be established, decide on a national policy that the whole country unanimously agrees upon, and on the basis of this unity of all the Japanese citizens petition the emperor to exercise his authority so that while giving homage to the emperor the foundation for the reorganization of the nation can forthwith be established.
 


	 
	Our seven hundred million brethren in China and India have no way of establishing their independence without our aid and help. In our Japan, the population has doubled in the last fifty years, and based on the rate of population growth there is no doubt that we will need territory in the next hundred years to sustain a population of at least two hundred and forty or fifty million. A hundred years for a country are comparable to a hundred days for an individual. How can those who are concerned about this inevitable future, or saddened by the wretched state of neighboring countries, find comfort in the pacifist ideas of doctrinaire socialism. I can positively say that there is no denying that a society progresses through class war, but what is this so-called social science that closes its eyes to wars between people and wars between nations that have taken place since the beginning of mankind. The authority of the European theory of revolution is based on such a shallow and superficial philosophy so that when it is necessary to comprehend this philosophy of the 'gospel of the sword' then the noble Greece of Asian civilization itself must take the initiative for the reorganization of the nation, and waving the flag for an Asian alliance and a world alliance, spread the teachings of the Way of Heaven to the Four Seas that all people are children of the Buddha.
 


	 
	I. The Emperor: The Creation of a Total Dictatorship 
	SUSPENSION OF THE CONSTITUTION 
	For the emperor and all the Japanese people to determine the basis for the national reorganization on the basis of imperial authority the constitution will be suspended for three years and both houses dissolved and the entire nation brought under martial law.
 


	 
	Note 1: There is no doubt that in extraordinary times harmful views and voted should be ignored. To regard an assembly or constitution as an absolute ideal is to accept a literal translation of a hallowed idea of (kyokenteki) Western democracy. Those who think in this way are obdurate conservatives hiding the real principles of ‘democracy’. They resemble the ludicrous arguments of those who explain Japan’s kokutai on the basis of [Shinto mythical] theories of the High Plain of Heaven. 
	It cannot be said that in debating a bill on naval expansion one vote of Admiral Togo [the hero of the 1905 Battle of Tsushima Straits] is not worth more than the three votes of the disgraceful Diet members, or that in voting on social programmes one vote by Karl Marx is not worth more than seven cast by Okura Kihachiro [entrepreneur and founder of one of Japan’s largest zaibatsu]. The effect of giving an absolute value to the present form of a government elected by votes ignores those people that have value and is nothing but support for the old order. 
	Note 2: People who think that a coup d’etat is an abuse of power for a conservative autocracy are people who ignore history. Napoleon did not compromise with conservative elements even when a large majority of the assembly and the newspapers were full of elements seeking to restore monarchical government and, so, ushered in a pure revolutionary period. As can be seen in the example of the present Russian revolution even though Lenin dissolved the assembly, which was full of harmful elements armed with machine guns, popular opinion still sees a coup d’etat as the act of conservative forces.
 


	 
	Note 3: A coup d’etat should be seen as the direct exercise of national power that is the social will. If we look at the progress of people then they, too, have come from popular groups. Political leaders such as Napoleon and Lenin give rise to such people. With the reorganization of Japan there will certainly be a coalition of popular groups and the leader, leading to the development of power.
 


	 
	Note 4: The necessity of dissolving the two houses is that the nobility and the rich classes who support these houses cannot support the emperor and the people in carrying out the reorganization. The reason for the necessity of suspending the constitution is that these people seek the protection of the present laws enacted under this constitution. The necessity of promulgating martial law is in order that the freedom of the country to suppress their resistance is not restricted in any way. However, those who in ignorance transplant a semi-revolutionary theory from abroad to argue for reorganization must also be suppressed.
 


	 
	THE TRUE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EMPEROR 
	The fundamental principles of the emperor as the representative of the people and pillar of the nation must be made clear. 
	To make this principle clear a complete reform of the imperial court will be carried out on the basis of the spirit of the founder of the nation, Emperor Jimmu, and the revolution under the great Emperor Meiji and the present privy councilors and other officials will be dismissed and talent to assist the emperor will be sought from the realm. 
	An advisory council to assist the emperor will be established. The members of this council will be appointed by the emperor and the council will consist of fifty members. 
	A member of the advisory council must tender his resignation to the emperor when the cabinet committee takes action against him or the Diet passes a vote of no-confidence against him. However, they will not be responsible to either the cabinet or the Diet.
 


	 
	CONDEMNATION OF WESTERN DEMOCRACY 
	[…] Note 2: There is absolutely no scientific basis for the thinking that a 'democracy', that is, a state system in which the representatives of the people are selected by an electoral system is better than a system where the state is represented by a single person. The nation differs according to the spirit of the peoples of each nation and the history of the formation of the nation. One cannot say that China, which has had a republican government for eight years is more rational than Belgium where one person represents the nation. The American idea of 'democracy' is based on the idea of a society formed through the free will of individuals who enter into a free contract and the extremely crude ideas of the time that individuals broke away from the original countries of Europe and formed village communities and these became nations. The theory of the divine right of voters was a feeble philosophy, merely the obverse of the divine right of kings. This did not happen with the establishment of Japan, and neither was there a period when such a feeble philosophy was dominant. A system where the head of the state has to manipulate views by selling his name, refining his mannerisms like a low-class actor to fight elections, is for the Japanese race who have been brought up to believe that silence is golden and modesty a virtue, invitation enough to remain a mute spectator to this strange custom….
 


	 
	II. Limit on Private Wealth 
	A Japanese citizen will be allowed to own property up to a limit of Yen 3,000,000 per family. The same ceiling will apply to Japanese nationals owning property abroad. Violations of this limit by donating the property to blood relatives or others, and attempts to transfer ownership in any other manner, will not be permitted. 
	Note: Though establishing a ceiling and permitting private wealth below Yen 3 million, I recognize the various theories of social revolution which totally reject private wealth as a final objective and seek to fundamentally transform the understanding of man and Society. The individual's freedom to act and seek enjoyment should not be dependent on private wealth. It is a different and an unimportant problem that some people in reaction to the theories arising from a view of society as all powerful, disregard differences in wealth and urge a uniform equality. I, however, argue that as individuals' abilities differ, the system must recognize these differences. Man cannot be equal in the desire for physical enjoyment and physical activity….
 


	 
	GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY EXCEEDING THE LIMIT 
	The state will take over all property exceeding the ceiling without paying compensation. 
	The existing law cannot be used to justify refusal to hand over such property. If there is someone who seeks to violate this law, he will be seen as bringing into contempt the authority of the emperor and endangering the fundamental principles of the Reorganization of the nation. The crime of endangering the emperor and that of rebellion against the nation will be enforced during the period of martial law, and for such crimes the death sentence is administered.
 


	 
	Note 1: The present state, seem from the point of economic organization, is not a unified state but in its economic system it is at the stage of the ‘warring states’, that is it is a feudal state. 
	In America the political rule of the daimyo was eventually established. The state has progressed from a period when the bushi or warriors as a family, raised private armies, to fight aggressive wars of subjugation, to the present state of unity. Similarly, only by ending the economic feudal structure with its private economic armies will it be possible to bring about the internal economic unity of the state.
 


	 
	Note 2: The reason for not giving compensation to the present big capitalists and big landlords for the appropriation is that these few people have been able to accumulate this wealth, which is actually the product of common social progress and common production, because of an iniquitous system. The second reason is that if they are compensated from the public debt then they will, as earlier, have the wealth to injure the economic unity of the country. The third reason is that the state cannot spread this compensation to this illogical ownership of capital which is actually the capital of the state and which, for the first time in history, can be directly administered by the state.
 


	 
	Note 3: The death penalty is not something that is desirable. It is also surely not necessary to consider the vengeful uprisings of the propertyless. Actually, in collecting the land of the nobility, we shall learn from the prudent foresight of the ancient wisdom of Saigo Takamori, who said that if there are any dissenting domains (han) they should be subjugated. Seeing the death of one or two people everyone will obey.
 


	 
	In the future, after the reorganization, those who acquire wealth exceeding the ceiling on private property will deliver that amount to the state. 
	The state will regard this as rational labour and accept this payment as a donation and will adopt a policy of clearly regarding this as meritorious labour. It will not be possible, with the intention of avoiding this objective, to distribute or donate to blood relatives or others. The penalty for violators will be decided under the law. 
	It should be understood that he origin of wealth at present and after the Reorganization will be different…. 
	IV. Unification of Big Capital by the State
 


	 
	LIMITS ON PRIVATELY-OWNED ENTERPRISES 
	The capital of privately-owned enterprises will be limited to Yen 10 million. The same will be applicable to privately-owned Japanese enterprises abroad. 
	Note 1: The ceiling on private property and on private enterprises will not be considered in the same way. The ceiling on those who own private enterprises, whether limited on unlimited, and conduct business using loans will be completely different from the former.
 


	 
	Note 2: There are many reasons, as is clear from earlier notes, why we permit limited private enterprise. One reason is that one of the motives of man’s economic activity is governed by self-interest. A second reason is that when trying a new experiment it is not possible to wait
 


	 
	for everyone to initiate it and therefore, it is always necessary to use the creative powers of certain individuals. A third reason is that no matter how much a public production system develops it cannot fulfill all the needs of the people, and therefore, in the future, in real terms it will, as before, be dependent largely on the private economic activity of small capital. The fourth reason is that the government must support and develop freedom of economic activity because freedom and the human rights of people are dependent on this. These reasons show that as a constructive theory, the fundamental ideas of socialism are wrong and that is why it has not been able to win support worldwide….
 


	 
	NATIONALIZATION OF ENTERPRISES THAT EXCEED THE CEILING 
	Those enterprises that exceed the ceiling on private enterprises will be consolidated and managed by the state. 
	Compensation will be made by public bonds bearing 3 per cent interest. Compensation and its relation to private wealth will be based entirely on the limit on private wealth….
 


	 
	Note 1: There is no need to explain that according to socialism big capital is the product of the accumulation of social capital. It is also natural that society, that is the state, receives what it accumulates.
 


	 
	Note 2: Currently, big capital works for its own private benefit and under its private management, just as the daimyo used soldiers to kill and control the lives of people for their own, individual purposes. Within China, at present, where private armies are fighting for their own interests it is unimaginable that any political unification can take place. It is comparable to the state in the USA which allows railways, telegraph and other social amenities to be controlled by private capital and therefore is like China, in that capitalists are fighting among themselves. If the sole purpose of the state is to ensure peace and order among the people then the capitalists who continually threaten the people must be curbed by the state, and if it does not do this then it is tantamount to there being no state. There is no reason to fear anarchists but it is very dangerous if a state itself neglects its own duties and functions.
 


	 
	Note 3: Looked at positively, it Is a more rational form (of governance) when the state takes the initiative for the unification of 'big capital' than the US 'trusts' and the German 'cartels'. You can presume that the future productive powers of the state will be far greater than in the earlier period of confiscations, as there is a far more reasonable match between theory and practice.
 


	 
	Note 4: The very rich will be left with only Yen 1 million, as the state will acquire enterprises and land in excess of this. At the same time, those with stock or capital of less than Yen I million will be compensated, without injury, when the state acquires the companies in excess of this. The middle and lower classes will not be inconvenienced in the least; only the upper will be affected…. 
	VII. Reorganization Plan for Korea and Other Present and Future Possessions 
	[….]
 


	 
	PROCEDURE FOR THE REFORM OF PRESENT JAPANESE POSSESSIONS 
	The reform of Korea, Taiwan, Karafuto and the other territories will first be limited to establishing the three great principles [limit on private wealth, the limit on private property, and the limit on private industry] and then to gradually implementing the remaining Reorganization plan so that within ten or twenty years the same conditions and the right to existence will prevail as in Japan. However, once the internal reform of Japan is over and martial law completed, then at the same time the three great principles will be enforced….
 


	 
	Note 2: One of the reasons for the present rebellion in Korea is because of the viceroy's policy, and the fundamental cause it should be known lies in the invasion of Japanese capitalists and their working with the bureaucrats to take over the land of the Koreans and plunder their property, bringing unrest into their lives and adding enmity to a bare existence. That fellow Wilson, what effect does his proclamation have! It must not be forgotten that with the poisoning of the nation, internally and externally, what eventually brought about the destruction of Great Rome was the politics of money.
 


	 
	It is desirable to implement all the reorganization organizations in the new territories. If the people of territories acquired in the future are at a cultural level equal to the Japanese then when the territories are acquired the complete Reorganization plan will have to be implemented. However, Reorganization organizations sent from mainland Japan will carry out this reorganization. 
	After having acquired the territories, other races and peoples who migrate (ijinshu imin zoku) to these territories will have the right to acquire citizenship if they have lived for more than ten years, and will have all the rights, without any discrimination, as Japanese citizens….
 


	 
	Note 1: For instance, if Australia acquires the level of the people's culture, it will, it is hoped, really continue to thrive under the Reorganized institutions. Given the level of development of Far Eastern Siberia, for example, first the three great principles will be implemented and then others in an orderly manner and the remaining regulations.
 


	 
	Note 2: Japan must show the ideal to the West in the new possessions by taking measures to completely stop any discrimination between races and peoples. In Australia, the Indian race, the people of China, and far-eastern Siberia, and Korea will be welcomed and united together with the white people who have been there from before. Thus, in the whole world, only the Empire of Japan will govern a union of Western and Eastern civilizations. In the territories, if the Reorganized institutions are enforced and the sovereign people themselves control the violence of private interests and sweep away the original rich white settlers then it will become possible to lay the foundations of a true paradise for world brotherhood. It is mere child's play to spread colour on a map. The Japanese people who have been selected to spread the message of heaven (tendo senpu) should not, it is evident, become a second England, which is collapsing because of heaven's rebuke….
 


	 
	VIII. Plans for a War of Liberation against Western Imperialism 
	[….] 
	THE RIGHT TO INITIATE A WAR 
	The nation has the right to initiate a war, not just for self-defence but also for the other nations and races who are suppressed by an unprincipled power. (To give a concrete example, it is the right of a nation to launch a war for the independence of India or the protection of China.)
 


	The nation also has the right to launch a war against a nation that, for its own development, illegally occupies another territory and ignores the Way of Heaven (tondo) of the mutual coexistence of races. (To give a concrete example, it is the right of a nation to launch a war against the occupiers of Manchuria and Far-Eastern Siberia.)
 


	 
	Note 1: The world powers, when they seek to start a war today only deceive themselves and others when they use the old moral justifications, and moreover they use these excuses for self-protection not really understanding the right of a nation to exist; this is really a form of cowardice. If they genuinely understood this then they would confidently proclaim war. Japan, to develop vigorously, cannot go to war simply for private profit and selfish desires but only for justice. It must be seen as equally just when other races change the status quo by actively raising their own awareness and try and expel occupiers and invaders. Personal gain is not an evil crime, just as suicide is not a moral issue. Therefore, profit in itself is not unjust but correct gain is transformed into an offence and in trying to gain this advantage you miss justice.
 


	 
	Unarguably, the present situation is not just. Just like the situation in which England used India as a beast of burden for its interest is not justice, in the same manner the condition in which Australia is blockaded from the 700 million people of neighbouring Japan and Asia is also not a just one. Just as the self-interest of the Tsar in trying to annex China and colonize Korea is unjust in the present time, so the present policy of the 'Lenin' government is unjust if it is seeking to monopolize the wide and barren spaces of Siberia and ignoring the interests of other countries. Just as the lass war within a nation is fought because a line of division is drawn against justice, so also in international relations, in the case of a just war it seeks to redraw an unjust line of division fairly. Britain, astride the whole world, is like a very rich man and Russia is landlord of half the northern world. Doesn't Japan, which is like a propertyless person in international society confined to these small islands, have the right to go to war to overthrow their domination In the name of justice?
 


	 
	HYPOCRISY OF WESTERN SOCIALISTS 
	The Western socialists have a fundamental contradiction in their thinking when they criticize Japan's war as an invasion and militarism, for they accept the war of the proletariat within a nation and Japan in international society is in the position of the proletariat. Even while 'Hughes' is of working class origins and Lenin is a person respected by fellow socialists, looking at them from the point of international conflict, they are big landlords, just as in olden times, Okura Kihachiro started as a fish seller and Kato Komei was a poor student, but from the point 
	of the proletariat they are rich people. Within the country the proletariat is organizing itself institutionally and preparing to seek power, and if they seek to emphasize that they will change this unjust condition violently then Japan, which internationally is the proletariat, should strengthen its army and navy which are the institutions within which power is concentrated, and then start a war to change the unjust line of division and have this unconditionally accepted. If this is expansionism and militarism, then with the encouragement of the world proletariat, Japan should wear it as a crown of gold. Even under the rationalization of democratic socialism, Japan can demand Australia and eastern Siberia. Even with abundant harvests, after several years there won't be enough land to provide food. Even with greater distribution within the country, without international distribution, Japan will not resolve problems in an eternity. However, you should be careful of the fact that in German socialism there is no understanding of this international division, as it is ruled by the medieval institution of the Kaiser's government, which is why it received as unjust the rational claims for the redistribution of English possessions, and because of this these medieval institutions will collapse.
 


	 
	Therefore, if the Japan of military and financial cliques raises these demands it would follow the footsteps of Germany, a fact that is clear as light. All explanations support the argument that a reformed and rational state: a revolutionary empire must fight for international justice.
 


	 
	INDIA: JAPAN SHOULD HELP THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT 
	Note 2: Be prepared for the problem of Indian independence, which will be like 'Sarajevo' for the coming Second World War. However, Japan's mission should naturally be demonstrated in efficient aid. Even if Britain permits them the so-called autonomy and does not expel them from the 'John Bull Society' they will rise in rebellion as fundamentally they want independence. The defeat of the Indian independence movement during the First World War is solely due to the loyalty of Japan to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and, therefore, because England has so far had an invincible army they are now lying low for a while. The major principle behind Japan's aid must be that their independence can only be aided efficiently on the seas. Indian independence, moreover, is like the independence of America. The thirteen states of America, when they began their war of independence, were initially defeated continually by British troops and only later was victory possible when the really effective aid of the French navy off the Cape of Maine destroyed the British navy and made the transport of troops impossible. As without the aid of foreign armies, colonial Americans did not have weapons, so Indian independence fighters, whose arms have been completely captured and so troops can be sent at will to suppress them, and therefore their independence will be in the far future.
 


	 
	As the decisive factor in the independence of America was the French navy, so also the decisive factor in the success or failure of Indian independence will depend on what the navy of Japan or those countries which would ally with Japan, will do to destroy the British navy. There is not a great deal of use in having the aid of the Japanese army. Rather, after the war, the establishment of concessions will sow troubles, and it should be clearly stated that any compensation from India will quickly foul the proclamation of the principles of the Heavenly Way…. Japan, based on this Reorganization and with the wealth of the nation, should with great speed, develop its naval power. Japan and Britain cannot maintain neutral relations, and there are 
	only two ways, either to support the present dependent status or as its conqueror to seek its break-up. There will be no need for Japan in the future to seek to make India a dependent country, politically, culturally, and intellectually, and slaughter its patriots. If all the people in Japan desire as apostles of the Heavenly Way to follow the road, then it is necessary to have a militarist organization, which is capable of destroying British militarism on the seas…. Militarism will be a title for Japan and she will be the Jehovah of Indian independence. The pacifists who profane and falsely slander the Jehovah of the thousands of soldiers, are really using the conciliatory language of the Devil who fears the anger of Jehovah and seeks to continue violence and evil. Those who imitate the British are a hundred times worse than those who propagate Lenin.
 


	 
	BRITISH IMPERIALISM AIMS AT CHINA 
	Note 3: China will, as a result of the First World War, change rapidly, just as India will seek to change…. There is no need to explain that England seeks to make China into an economic quasi-dependency…. It is unarguable that Britain, with India as a base, and through Afghanistan and Persia will invade central Asia, and it is clear that in connection with Hong Kong as a base for the far-eastern sea they are thinking of dividing the area south of central China. This is the greatest danger faced by China, even more than the earlier invasion of Manchuria by Russia. Therefore, to Japan, which supports the idea of protecting China by confronting England, the importance of Hong Kong in the plan to invade China is no less than the role of Port Arthur and Vladivostok during the Russo-Japanese War. England does not even consider the merely verbal resistance of Japan as it has an army that has defeated all its enemies and desires China. This is not a mere conjecture. It can be proved with facts…. The time to debate about whether to go to war with England to protect China has long passed.
 


	 
	Note 4: Japan should accept the criticism of the international community in its dealings with China that it is an ambitious country and hopes to learn to be a Germany of the East, but it should also manfully reflect on it and want to change…. The Heavenly Way does not call country A's evil acts a crime and the same acts by country B aid. If Japan is called the Germany of the East then equally, like Germany, it will be a militarist expansionist country and it is the will of Heaven that Japan will be abashed and sweat profusely with shame when it listens to Wilson's lecture in front of the eyes of the concerned Western powers…. The reason why anti-Japanese voices have been raised all over China and America is that Japan was forced to protect China even though China thought she was being protected in the Russo-Japanese War and the United States also backed the war. These protests are a warning for the protectors from Heaven of the pitfalls ahead of them. The 'arrogant child Kaiser' did not reflect on this worldwide rejection and fell into a trap. Reflecting on the anti-Japanese feeling in China and America, as the first priority and reconsidering the divine declaration of the Russo-Japanese War Japan should realize that in this anti-Japanese feeling is the limitless love of Heaven: instead of acquiring concessions in Tsingtao with the blessings of England, Japan should capture her Hong Kong and make it a base for the Japanese Navy. If Hong Kong is made a base then places like Tsingtao will be of no use. Instead of a difficult intervention in the peripheral area of Shandong, a poor part of China, and using a force that will have to be specially sent out there, let us annex Australia which is larger than China and fertile. As far as Japan is concerned, it will suffice if China is not divided. How can the cowardly people who desire China where people have lived for four-thousand years build a worldwide empire? When Japan raises its head and looks directly at the British possessions then all traces of China's anti-Japanese feelings will fundamentally and forever be eradicated.
 


	 
	THE NEED FOR JAPAN TO CONQUER EASTERN SIBERIA 
	Note 5: Japan has the right, based on a comprehensive theory for protecting China, to control far-eastern Siberia and this acquisition will also work to counter traditional Russian policy which poses a danger to China from the north. After Japan obtains the Chinese Eastern Railway…and links far-eastern Siberia, China on its own strength should be able to defend Inner and Outer Mongolia from Russian invasion. In this manner Japan will draw a large circle in the north and protect China, and China will be Japan's forward base.
 


	 
	The China policy of the militarists, which seeks to build defences to invade Inner Mongolia after the Russian invasion of Outer Mongolia, has protected China up to a certain point but will end up in dividing it…. If you believe that the nation has the right to publicly declare war, then it is desirable to emphasize the necessity of Japan and China demanding that Lenin cede far-eastern Siberia. Because the normal right of a nation is kept secret under the pretext of a 'Czechoslovak aid' plan, Japan is suspected by friends and foes of hiding bad ambitions. Japan's actions abroad should be that not an inch of land should be taken unnecessarily but should the need arise then it should be in the healthy spirit done openly, under the light of Heaven and the sun, taking the whole world and yet finding it small.
 


	 
	Note 6: In order to ensure the safety of the Sea of Japan, Korea and China, that is, for the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War against Russia, Japan who wants to possess far-eastern Siberia should not lack for a big army. Moreover, in accordance with the destiny of the three principles of national polity, Japan should assist Indian independence and secure the protection of China by acquiring the southern parts of Asia. Japan, because it must fully oppose England, needs to urgently acquire a large navy. If during the present war the Great Saigo or the Meiji emperor had been here they would have acted in concert with German troops to subdue Russia with our navy dividing the British navy's preparations between the home country and India and Australia, so creating a very favourable situation to defeat each wing separately; rapidly building, within a year, an empire from Russia in the north to Australia in the south…. 
	Note 7: I will only mention one important vital fact…. America is afraid of Japanese immigrants. The American possession of the Philippines is a concern for Japan. The conflict between Japan and America is over capital investments in China. At first glance, there seems to be incompatibility but actually it is not the time to say which way the two countries, Japan and America, will be guided to an alliance by the wondrous plan of Heaven. There is just one thing to do: wait for a great hero to appear after the fundamental Reorganization. The first urgent matter for a movement by the Japanese beyond the boundaries of law (chohoritsuteki undo), under the leadership of the emperor, will be to completely excise the privileged classes, both economically and politically, because of the worry within and the distress outside; the cause of all these troubles comes out of this tumour. Japan is at the moment standing on the precipice of whether it will take nothing or everything. The urgent need of a national Reorganization exceeds that of the Meiji ishin-kakumei. However, the benevolence of Heaven will, depending on the excision of this tumour, determine the health of Japan.
 


	 
	CONCLUSION: JAPAN AS THE LEADER OF A GLOBAL REVOLUTION 
	….f someone calls the General Principles of the Reorganization of Japan a social revolutionary theory it would not be wrong…. In the past the waves of ideas from Europe and America washed over Japan, but to deny that the wave of Japanese civilization will wash over America is really unscientific. The civilizations of Egypt and Babylon were followed by the Greek civilization, which in turn was replaced by Roman civilization. After the Roman civilization came that of individual nation-states…. A narrow-minded theory from Indian civilization became the basis of Western religious philosophy but all traces of this in India itself were wiped out and its passage in China left only the bare bones. Only in a tiny island in the Eastern Sea was it closely treasured as a Great Way. Here it became Japanized, and later modernized, and now universalized and, after the coming of the Second World War, its revival will brighten the whole world. The renaissance of olden times will be nothing in comparison. The Western-Eastern culture will be of Asian thought Japanized and universalized, which will enlighten the vulgar, so-called civilized peoples. 
	The universe moves in a proper way, countries advance and decline. Just as for a few hundred years the countries of Europe did not allow people like Genghis Khan of the Mongol people to rule them, now how many years will the Anglo-Saxon tribe trample the world? History progresses. There are steps to advance. Historical progress in the East and West has gone through a 'warring states' (sengoku) period and after that followed what can be called the collective unification of feudal states, and so on up to the present international 'warring states' period and now the next stage is reached when world peace is made possible because a very powerful nation appears which will reign over the small and the big nations of the world, and establish a feudal peace (hokenteki heiwa). The various theories of world peace that seek to do away with national frontiers, based on the establishment of their ideals, ignore the conditions that make this possible, namely the realization of the great scientific inventions and the spiritual surge. The reality of ideals in all parts of the world is that there is always only one Toyotomi, Tokugawa, or one sacred emperor. The Japanese people should consider that the older meaning of sovereignty, the supreme right, above the right to control, will be revived internationally and that the Supreme State, which controls various states, will be realized. The Land of the Gods is narrated in myths…. That the star flag of America presided over the meeting at the Versailles palace implicitly reveals that it was a dark night for the world. The Japanese rising sun flag, after defeating England, making India independent and China self-reliant will shed the light of Heaven on all the people of the world. The coming again of Christ, prophesied all over the world, is actually the Japanese people's scripture and sword in the shape of Mohammed. The Japanese people should face the historically unprecedented national difficulties that are coming by reforming the political and economic organizations based on the Fundamental Principles for the Reorganization of Japan. Japan, as the Greece of Asian civilization, destroyed a strong Russia, as Persia was in the sea battle of Salamis. It will only be then that the real awakening of the 700 million people of China and India begins. On the road to Heaven there is no peace without war."," 2: Be prepared for the problem of Indian independence, which will be like 'Sarajevo' for the coming Second World War. However, Japan's mission should naturally be demonstrated in efficient aid. Even if Britain permits them the so-called autonomy and does not expel them from the 'John Bull Society' they will rise in rebellion as fundamentally they want independence. The defeat of the Indian independence movement during the First World War is solely due to the loyalty of Japan to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and, therefore, because England has so far had an invincible army they are now lying low for a while. The major principle behind Japan's aid must be that their independence can only be aided efficiently on the seas. Indian independence, moreover, is like the independence of America. The thirteen states of America, when they began their war of independence, were initially defeated continually by British troops and only later was victory possible when the really effective aid of the French navy off the Cape of Maine ",2017-09-25,Kita Ikki - Outline Plan for the Reorganization of Japan,Oklahoma City,Oklahoma,US

	Title: Tartarus
 


	Setting: New England, year 2268.
 


	Plot: Having narrowly escaped death at the hands of a race of alien tribals, a woman finds herself in orbit of Earth in the year 2268. She finds that her body is completely foreign to her, among many things being cybernetically augmented. She is approached by a man who is similarly augmented and told that her entire life up to this point was essentially a simulation and that the world as she knows it has changed significantly. The United Federation of Earth Nations, an international organization that essentially serves as a World Government, has declined in its power in recent years, with all of Humanity’s interstellar colonies having been lost to alien powers. She is told of the crimes of the World Government, but she looks down upon Earth and sees the brilliantly shining cities, wondering how this could have happened. She refuses to believe the man; she wants to see Earth for herself, to see if it has truly decayed as he says. Remembering her violent past, she wants to see if this future Earth could be a utopia; if it has been unified as he has said, then it may just be a world free of violence, free of war. She travels to the city of Portland, Maine of 2268 to see if this could be Utopia. She finds that not only does the World Government allow violent aliens to live among the Terrans, the Humans of Earth, but the Humans themselves are barely worthy of the name; they live purposeless lives, leaving no mark on the universe with their passing. They have neither past nor future, and their present is completely meaningless. Having seen this, she falls into a deep depression, wondering what can be done. The man that awakened her has a solution: find a new world and rebuild Mankind. He tells her of a now-dead world called Acheron, where the Humans, the Acherans, lived lives of purpose and meaning. He tells her of a way that Acheron can live again: a terraformation device being developed by the World Government. The Acherans seek to get their hands on this device by staging a revolution around Earth. Though skeptical, the woman agrees to help in this revolt.
 


	(To explain some terms, Terran in this story refers to a human that is basically the same as modern-day humans, while Acheran refers to the humans of Acheron, who are adapted to the environment of their planet through both genetic and cybernetic augmentation.)

	I am a 19 year old Finnish American. I was born in Rovaniemi and lived in Sodankylä until I was 5, where I moved to New Hampshire / Maine where I lived with my parents. I attend a University in Quebec at the moment, and I have been living there for a while now. 
 


	Political History
 


	I had always been around conservativism, with my father being a US Navy veteran. Although his beliefs are incredibly hostile to mine, I did learn the importance of traditionalism, anti modernity and honor from a very early age. As time went on, I eventually redpilled myself, along with reading a lot of material, and through time I became what I am now. 
 


	Reasons for Joining
 


	I want to grow stronger with the religion of Fascism. I want to learn everything, read everything, and act with other Fascists to achieve the goals we all want. I hate sitting at my apartment not doing anything. I want to be active, I want to do. 
 


	Skills
 


	I am an author and a musician. I always look to better myself, and to improve and push my condition. I would say a good trait that I have is that I am principled and I believe in absolute dedication and discipline. I am very much a pursuer of such goals. 
 


	Interests
 


	Like I said, I am an author and musician. I like tabletop RPG's, black metal, nature, weight lifting, food, history, and the occult. I want to learn more about the mysticism of Fascism and National Socialism. I real Evola heavily. 
 


	Projects
 


	As of now, nothing, but I am very much interested in joining or forming a group/alliance. I am open to anything

By James Mason 
 
  
Overview 
  
George Lincoln Rockwell is today commonly remembered as the founder and leader of the American Nazi Party. To persons within and without the Movement he helped shape, this limited understanding and appraisal of the man would appear to be shared in common. Both for the people for which he fought and the comrades with whom he fought, who today carry on in his memory, it is important that a better and deeper perspective of the man, his career and his long-range impact on the present and the future be appreciated. 
  
Commander Rockwell was the single most important figure in the post-war Movement. 
  
Before Rockwell and even throughout his career, not only all of the people to which the Movement is dedicated but most of who were to eventually make up that Movement were caught in the same trap of cursing and denying their greatest champion: Adolf Hitler. Before Rockwell, all would flee in terror when accused by their enemies in the System of being ""Nazis"". Only through Rockwell's efforts and sacrifice has the Movement and, yet to come, the entire people, been handed hack the name of their greatest leader, his political and philosophical idea, National Socialism, plus the symbol of that idea as well as of the people themselves: the Swastika. 
  
Until Rockwell there was nothing even remotely approaching what could have been called a common Movement ideology. There were merely assorted conservatives, racists, reactionaries, anti-Communists and anti-Semites. Rockwell adapted the National Socialist Worldview for universal White acceptance and practical usage through his written programs and gave the new Movement-to-be its first rallying cry, ""White Power!"" 
  
Prior to Commander Rockwell's example, no one inside or outside the Movement dared to openly and positively name World Jewry as the foremost enemy and cause of the major ills of White society. The rest in post-war America were either ignorant of the reality or they, out of fear of what they knew to be the real power, chose to conceal it and thus become part of the same conspiracy. 
  
As the first post-war American to not only openly embrace Adolph Hitler, to openly espouse National Socialism, to openly wear the Swastika and to include historic arid political anti-Semitism in his programs, Commander Rockwell was also the first to assail what he called the biggest ""Big Lie"": the so-called ""Holocaust"". It was he who first began to reverse the fraudulent ""guilt' sense that Whites were being told they most bear as well as to begin to demolish the worst social, political and economic scam in history. For this he was regarded as worse than a lunatic at the time. 
  
As a leader and a strategist, Rockwell has never been equaled in degree of sheer effectiveness. In the face of an openly declared media ""quarantine"" against him, he kept his message of White unity and resistance before the American public and the world for the nine years he headed the Party. In order to accomplish this he did what all the rest believed couldn't be done: He publicly demonstrated and physically confronted the ever-growing, ever more arrogant anti White elements in the street. What was more, he not only survived but grew in strength as well. 
  
While Rockwell was renowned in his day for demanding scrupulous legality from his followers, often to the point of generating suspicion in many corners of the Movement, he will still be recalled as the first and greatest of the Movement radicals and revolutionaries for his constant emphasis upon the element of White racial and political treason within the System itself, without which no number of racial aliens and no amount of alien conspiracy could pose a serious threat to White life, culture and security. 
  
And while no– or next to no– ""Nazi"" groups, per se, exist on the scene any longer, George Lincoln Rockwell's' spirit and leadership have long since come to pervade every single aspect– high and low of the Movement which, so long ago, had the wits frightened and embarrassed out of it by this man whom it then wished would just go away. His own prophecy is only lately beginning to make itself manifest... 
  
""I knew I would not live to see the victory which I would make possible. But I would not die before I had made that victory certain.""

	I discovered Ironmarch back in December and started frequently lurking in February. In terms of political history, I have discovered recently that I have been a Fascist for my entire life without realizing it. As such, my political ""history"" is more like a history of groups that I identified with because their views were the most in line with mine that I knew of. I started off my political history as an American Conservative. I was with that movement for a few years before becoming fed up with their incompetence at fighting various degeneracies. In 2015, I started frequenting such sites as 4/pol/ and TRS and began to consider myself a White Nationalist. However, the attitudes of the people on these sites greatly pissed me off. The whole ""if it's white it's alright"" ""work within the system"" ""memes and Donald Trump will save the white race"" mentality infuriated me. After my ""conservative"" days, I had largely abandoned the idea of working within the system. The best thing that I'd say the White Nationalist movement did for me was to really open my eyes about the Jewish Question. In December, I discovered Ironmarch and found that my worldview was not ""White Nationalism"", but the Fascist Worldview of Truth. For my whole life, I have been quite interested in National Socialism, and I considered myself a National Socialist for a while during my WN days. However, it was when I discovered Ironmarch that I truly figured out what it means to be a Fascist. Fascism is not an idle interest or hobby, it is a worldview and lifestyle. With this realization, I began my education on the Fascist Worldview. Various materials that I have found on this site have greatly helped me. I found the American Futurism Workshop thread to be particularly cathartic. Even in my ""conservative"" years, I had always found American Patriotardism to be hollow and meaningless. I have never really thought of myself as a part of the American pseudo-nation, and I have longed for the day that the whole thing will simply come apart. I realize now that this cannot be an idle daydream; we must work towards the destruction of America actively.
 


	My purpose for joining the forum is twofold. First, I would like to continue my education on the Fascist worldview. While I have already learned much from the materials on this site, I hope to learn even more by interacting with actual Fascists. Second, I would like to begin participating in activism to wear down the system. While I may be a bit too young to do this as of now, I would like to look into joining up with the Atomwaffen Division.
 


	My views on various topics:
 


		God
	

	Throughout my life, I have gone through various phases of religiousness and irreligiousness. However, with the information I have now on the Fascist Worldview, I realize that it necessitates a belief in a higher power. As for exactly what religion I am, I am heavily leaning towards Esoteric Hitlerism. From what I have seen, EH is one of the only religions (if not the sole religion) to have not lost sight of the Truth. While such religions as Christianity and Paganism most certainly used to have the Truth in them, the process of involution and degeneration has eroded them so badly that even their leaders no longer preach Truth. Esoteric Hitlerism, however, is young enough that it has been able to completely retain the Truth in its doctrines.
 


		Race
	

	Racial purity is absolutely essential to the survival of a healthy nation. The blood of a people has the potential to unlock that people's particular racial soul, meaning that purity of blood will lead to purity of spirit. On the other hand, by miscegenating, a people makes its offspring worse in both a biological and spiritual sense, as they will be unable to achieve the things that a child of pure blood could.
 


		Jews
	

	Not to be trusted. Period. While the West would almost certainly still be suffering from Involution and degeneration if the Jews were not here, the process would at least be going slower. The presence of the Jew in the West has accelerated that process to the point that there is almost nothing salvageable about the West other than its blood. The Jew must be gassed, plain and simple, no exceptions.
 


		Fags
	

	Very similar to the Jew. Prevented by their own lust from being able to see the eternal Truth and therefore need to be thrown into the bog.
 


	That answers a few of the big questions. If you have any questions, comments, or criticisms, feel free to let me know!

For example: 
  
Activist: ""You're against transphobia, right?"" 
Typical spineless liberal: ""Well, yeah, I guess..."" 
Activist: ""Then surely you won't mind having your tax dollars go towards paying $75,000 to this transexual student who was discriminated against in Maine, right?"" 
Liberal: ""W-well, I don't know, that's a lot of money that could go towards improving the schools..."" 
Activist: ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, AREN'T YOU AGAINST TRANSPHOBIA?"" 
Liberal: ""Y-yeah..."" 
Activist: ""THEN YOU'LL HELP PAY FOR THIS LAWSUIT THEN!""
