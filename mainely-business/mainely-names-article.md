## What the 2010s really brought us: a lot more businesses with 'Mainely' in the name

Certainly you've seen a Maine business called Mainely such-and-such.

If you've ever wondered how many such enterprises exist in the state, let your curiosity stew upon the figure: 248. Another 355 "Mainely" listings on file with the Maine Office of the Secretary of State are inactive, dating back to the 1970s.

The 2010s gave us nearly half of those businesses.

Just ponder that for a moment: In the decade started Jan. 1, 2010, there had only been 329 "Mainely" businesses; by the end of the decade, there would be 603 on the books.

While the past decade brought on a number of other notable events -- [Gwyneth became a modern lifestyle brand](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/24/arts/2010s-decade-end.html), for instance -- it perhaps should most be remembered for the 2010 rise and 2019 fall of [Mainelyoldstuff](https://icrs.informe.org/nei-sos-icrs/ICRS?CorpSumm=20101191+D) and the new arrival of [Mainely Nuggets](https://icrs.informe.org/nei-sos-icrs/ICRS?CorpSumm=20203147DC).

But would the decade have been so notable without the foresight of the Maine Country Store of Wiscasset, which on April 6, 1973, filed to incorporate as the [Mainely Pine Country Store Inc.](https://icrs.informe.org/nei-sos-icrs/ICRS?CorpSumm=19731162+D).

The last of those registrants filed on Dec. 19, as [Mainely Solar](https://icrs.informe.org/nei-sos-icrs/ICRS?CorpSumm=20203933DC). That was just one of four Mainely businesses to file before the end of the year.
